	abstract = {The host inflammatory response in cystic fibrosis ({CF}) lung disease has long been recognized as a central pathological feature and an important therapeutic target. Indeed, many believe that bronchiectasis results largely from the oxidative and proteolytic damage comprised within an exuberant airway inflammatory response that is dominated by neutrophils. In this review, we address the longstanding argument of whether or not the inflammatory response is directly attributable to impairment of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or only secondary to airway obstruction and chronic bacterial infection and challenge the importance of this distinction in the context of therapy. We also review the centrality of neutrophils in {CF} lung pathophysiology and highlight more recent data that suggest the importance of other cell types and signaling beyond {NF}-κB activation. We discuss how protease and redox imbalance are critical factors in {CF} airway inflammation and end by reviewing some of the more promising therapeutic approaches now under development.},

Recent studies have provided new insights into the structural determinants of the channel's functional properties, such as anion selectivity, single-channel conductance, and gating. Using the scanning-cysteine-accessibility method we identified 7 residues in the M1 membrane-spanning segment and 11 residues in and flanking the M6 segment that are exposed on the water-accessible surface of the protein; many of these residues may line the ion-conducting pathway. The pattern of the accessible residues suggests that these segments have a largely alpha-helical secondary structure with one face exposed in the channel lumen. Our results suggest that the residues at the cytoplasmic end of the M6 segment loop back into the channel, narrowing the lumen, and thereby forming both the major resistance to ion movement and the charge-selectivity filter.},

The review begins with an introduction to the concepts of permeability and conductance and the Nernst-Planck and rate theory models that are used to interpret these parameters. Some of the physical forces that impinge on anion conductance are considered in the context of permeability selectivity and anion binding to proteins. Probes of the conduction process are considered, particularly permeant anions that bind tightly within the pore and block anion flow.

Over 500 naturally occurring mutations have been identified in {CF} gene which are located in all of the domains of the protein (Kerem et al., 1990; Mercier et al., 1993; Ghanem et al., 1994; Fanen et al., 1992; Ferec et al., 1992; Cutting et al., 1990). Early studies by several investigators characterized {CFTR} as a chloride channel (Anderson et al.; 1991b,c; Bear et al., 1991). The complex secondary structure of the protein suggested that {CFTR} might possess other functions in addition to being a chloride channel. Studies have established that the {CFTR} functions not only as a chloride channel but is indeed a regulator of sodium channels (Stutts et al., 1995), outwardly rectifying chloride channels ({ORCC}) (Gray et al., 1989; Garber et al., 1992; Egan et al., 1992; Hwang et al., 1989; Schwiebert et al., 1995) and also the transport of {ATP} (Schwiebert et al., 1995; Reisin et al., 1994).

	abstract = {Studies have shown that expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) is associated with enhanced glutathione ({GSH}) efflux from airway epithelial cells, implicating a role for {CFTR} in the control of oxidative stress in the airways. To define the mechanism underlying {CFTR}-associated {GSH} flux, we studied wild-type and mutant {CFTR} proteins expressed in Sf9 membranes, as well as purified and reconstituted {CFTR}. We show that {CFTR}-expressing membrane vesicles mediate nucleotide-activated {GSH} flux, which is disrupted in the R347D pore mutant, and in the Walker A K464A and K1250A mutants. Further, we reveal that purified {CFTR} protein alone directly mediates nucleotide-dependent {GSH} flux. Interestingly, although {ATP} supports {GSH} flux through {CFTR}, this activity is enhanced in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable {ATP} analog {AMP}-{PNP}. These findings corroborate previous suggestions that {CFTR} pore properties can vary with the nature of the nucleotide interaction. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that {GSH} flux is an intrinsic function of {CFTR} and prompt future examination of the role of this function in airway biology in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Confluent M-1 mouse cortical collecting duct ({CCD}) cells express highly selective low-conductance amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (B. Letz, A. Ackermann, C. M. Canessa, B. C. Rossier, and C. Korbmacher, J. Membr. Biol. 148: 129-143, 1995). Here we investigated the effect of forskolin on membrane voltage and whole cell currents of confluent M-1 cells using the patch-clamp technique. Forskolin (1 {microM}) reduced the hyperpolarization in response to amiloride (10 {microM}) from 17 to 4 {mV} and decreased the amiloride-sensitive Na+ inward currents from 81 to 26 {pA}. Furthermore, forskolin increased the hyperpolarization caused by changing from an apical low-Cl- solution (9 {mM}) to a high-Cl- solution (149 {mM}) from 11 to 30 {mV} and increased the magnitude of the inward current changes induced by alternating between high-Cl- and low-Cl- solutions from 25 to 138 {pA}. This demonstrates that forskolin stimulates an apical Cl- conductance. Anion substitution experiments revealed a permeability sequence {SCN}- {\textgreater} Br- {\textgreater} Cl- {\textgreater} I- {\textgreater} gluconate. This suggests that the stimulated channels are cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR})-like Cl- channels. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate mimicked the effects of forskolin, whereas 1,9-dideoxyforskolin had no effect. We conclude that, in addition to amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels, {CFTR}-like Cl- channels are present in the apical membrane of confluent M-1 cells. An increase in intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ({cAMP}) activates these Cl- channels and concurrently reduces the activity of the Na+ channels. This reciprocal regulation by {cAMP} suggests that the channels are functionally coupled.},

	abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) functions as a Cl- channel important in transepithelial salt and water transport. While there is a paucity of direct structural information on {CFTR}, much has been learned about the molecular determinants of the {CFTR} Cl- channel pore region and the mechanism of Cl- permeation through the pore from indirect structure-function studies. The first and sixth transmembrane regions of the {CFTR} protein play major roles in forming the channel pore and determining its functional properties by interacting with permeating Cl- ions. Positively charged amino acid side-chains are involved in attracting negatively charged Cl- ions into the pore region, where they interact briefly with a number of discrete sites on the pore walls. The pore appears able to accommodate more than one Cl- ion at a time, and Cl- ions bound inside the pore are probably sensitive to one another's presence. Repulsive interactions between Cl- ions bound concurrently within the pore may be important in ensuring rapid movement of Cl- ions through the pore. Chloride ion binding sites also interact with larger anions that can occlude the pore and block Cl- permeation, thus inhibiting {CFTR} function. Other ions besides Cl- are capable of passing through the pore, and specific amino acid residues that may be important in allowing the channel to discriminate between different anions have been identified. This brief review summarizes these mechanistic insights and tries to incorporate them into a simple cartoon model depicting the interactions between the channel and Cl- ions that are important for ion translocation.},

Here, we demonstrate that functionally similar low sulfonylurea affinity {KATP} channels are formed by two heterologous molecules, products of Kir1.1a and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) genes. Co-injection of {CFTR} and Kir1.1a {cRNA} into Xenopus oocytes lead to the expression of K+ selective channels that retained the high open probability behavior of Kir1.1a but acquired sulfonylurea sensitivity and {ATP}-dependent gating properties. Similar to the {KATP} channels in the kidney but different from {KATP} channels in excitable tissues, the Kir1.1a/{CFTR} channel was inhibited by glibenclamide with micromolar affinity. Since the expression of Kir1.1a and {CFTR} overlap at sites in the kidney where the low sulfonylurea affinity {KATP} are expressed, our study offers evidence that these native {KATP} channels are comprised of Kir1.1a and {CFTR}. The implication that Kir subunits can interact with {ABC} proteins beyond the subfamily of sulfonylurea receptors provides an intriguing explanation for functional diversity in {KATP} channels.},

Rev. 79, Suppl.: S145-S166, 1999. - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) is a member of the {ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) transporter gene family. Although {CFTR} has the structure of a transporter that transports substrates across the membrane in a nonconductive manner, {CFTR} also has the intrinsic ability to conduct Cl- at much higher rates, a function unique to {CFTR} among this family of {ABC} transporters. Because Cl- transport was shown to be lost in cystic fibrosis ({CF}) epithelia long before the cloning of the {CF} gene and {CFTR}, {CFTR} Cl- channel function was considered to be paramount. Another equally valid perspective of {CFTR}, however, derives from its membership in a family of transporters that transports a multitude of different substances from chemotherapeutic drugs, to amino acids, to glutathione conjugates, to small peptides in a nonconductive manner. Moreover, at least two members of this {ABC} transporter family (mdr-1, {SUR}) can regulate other ion channels in the membrane. More simply, {ABC} transporters can regulate somehow the function of other cellular proteins or cellular functions. This review focuses on a plethora of studies showing that {CFTR} also regulates other ion channel proteins. It is the hope of the authors that the reader will take with him or her the message that {CFTR} is a conductance regulator as well as a Cl- channel.},

	abstract = {{CFTR} mutations cause defects of {CFTR} protein production and function by different molecular mechanisms. The mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which mutations disrupt {CFTR} function. This understanding of the different molecular mechanism of {CFTR} dysfunction provides the scientific basis for development of targeted drugs for mutation specific therapy of {CF}. Class I mutations are nonsense mutations that result in the presence of premature stop codon that leads to the production of unstable {mRNA} or the release from the ribosome of a short truncated protein that is not functional. The aminoglycoside antibiotics can suppress premature termination codons by disrupting translational fidelity and allowing the incorporation of an amino acid, thus permitting translation to continue to the normal termination of the transcript. Class {II} mutations cause impairment of {CFTR} processing and folding in the Golgi. As a result the mutant {CFTR} is retained in the {ER} and eventually targeted for degradation by the quality control mechanisms. Chemical and molecular chaperons such as Sodium-4-phenylbutyrate can stabilize protein structure, and allow it to escape from degradation in the {ER} and be transported to the cell membrane. Class {III} mutations disrupt the function of the regulatory domain. {CFTR} is resistant to phosphorylation or {ATP} binding. {CFTR} activators such as alkylxanthines ({CPX}) and the flavonoid genistein can overcome the affected {ATP} binding through direct binding to a nucleotide binding fold. In patients carrying class {IV} mutations, phosphorylation of {CFTR} results in reduced chloride transport. Increases in the overall cell surface content of these mutants might overcome the relative reduction in conductance. Alternatively restoring native chloride pore characteristics pharmacologically might be effective. Activators of {CFTR} at the plasma membrane may function by promoting {CFTR} phosphorylation, by blocking {CFTR} dephosphorylation, by interacting directly with {CFTR}, and/or by modulation of {CFTR} protein-protein interactions. Class V mutations affect the spicing machinery and generate both aberrantly and correctly spliced transcripts, the level of which vary among different patients and among different organs of the same patient. Splicing factors that promote exon inclusion or factors that promote exon skipping can promote increase of correctly spliced transcripts, depending on the molecular defect. Inconsistent results were reported regarding the required level of corrected or mutated {CFTR} that has to be reached in order to achieve normal function.},

We determined the distribution of {CFTR} mutations in as many regions throughout the world as possible in an effort designed to: 1) increase our understanding of ancestry-genotype relationships, 2) compare mutational arrays with disease incidence, and 3) gain insight for decisions regarding screening program enhancement through {CFTR} multi-mutational analyses. Information on all mutations that have been published since the identification and cloning of the {CFTR} gene's most common allele, {DeltaF}508 (or F508del), was reviewed and integrated into a centralized database. The data were then sorted and regional {CFTR} arrays were determined using mutations that appeared in a given region with a frequency of 0.5\% or greater. Final analyses were based on 72,431 {CF} chromosomes, using data compiled from over 100 original papers, and over 80 regions from around the world, including all nations where {CF} has been studied using analytical molecular genetics. Initial results confirmed wide mutational heterogeneity throughout the world; however, characterization of the most common mutations across most populations was possible. We also examined {CF} incidence, {DeltaF}508 frequency, and regional mutational heterogeneity in a subset of populations. Data for these analyses were filtered for reliability and methodological strength before being incorporated into the final analysis. Statistical assessment of these variables revealed that there is a significant positive correlation between {DeltaF}508 frequency and the {CF} incidence levels of regional populations. Regional analyses were also performed to search for trends in the distribution of {CFTR} mutations across migrant and related populations; this led to clarification of ancestry-genotype patterns that can be used to design {CFTR} multi-mutation panels for {CF} screening programs. From comprehensive assessment of these data, we offer recommendations that multiple {CFTR} alleles should eventually be included to increase the sensitivity of newborn screening programs employing two-tier testing with trypsinogen and {DNA} analysis.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: To determine the relation between lower airway infection and inflammation, respiratory symptoms, and lung function in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis ({CF}).
{METHODS}: A prospective study of children with {CF} aged younger than 3 years, diagnosed by a newborn screening programme. All were clinically stable and had testing as outpatients. Subjects underwent bronchial lavage ({BL}) and lung function testing by the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique under general anaesthesia. {BL} fluid was cultured and analysed for neutrophil count, interleukin 8, and neutrophil elastase. Lung function was assessed by forced expiratory volume in 0.5, 0.75, and 1 second.
{RESULTS}: Thirty six children with {CF} were tested on 54 occasions. Lower airway infection shown by {BL} was associated with a 10\% reduction in {FEV}(0.5) compared with subjects without infection. No relation was identified between airway inflammation and lung function. Daily moist cough within the week before testing was reported on 20/54 occasions, but in only seven (35\%) was infection detected. Independent of either infection status or airway inflammation, those with daily cough had lower lung function than those without respiratory symptoms at the time of {BL} (mean adjusted {FEV}(0.5) 195 ml and 236 ml respectively).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In young children with {CF}, both respiratory symptoms and airway infection have independent, additive effects on lung function, unrelated to airway inflammation. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of airway obstruction in these young patients.},

While 10 of the 14 patients had elevated polymorphonuclear leukocyte ({PMN}) counts initially, only 4 had bacteria generally regarded as pathogenic in the recovered {BAL} fluid. Three of these 4 and 6 of the others had follow-up bronchoscopies at 6 months intervals. {PMN} counts remained normal for only one patient. However, pathogenic bacteria were recovered during the repeat {BALs} only in those patients who were colonized initially. Proinflammatory cytokines and proteinases were generally elevated, and interleukin-8 ({IL}-8) concentration correlated inversely with oxygen saturation ({SaO}2). No complications of the procedure occurred. We conclude that {BAL} identifies inflammation and the presence of bacteria in the lower airway at an early stage of the disease. This information may be used to guide therapy in patients too young or otherwise unable to produce sputum. These data also suggest that inflammation is present early in the course of {CF} lung disease before colonization and infection of the lungs with potentially pathogenic bacteria occurs. Since inflammation appears to be the earliest detectable evidence of lung disease in {CF}, monitoring of inflammation with {BAL} may serve as a useful marker of clinical benefits from new treatments in patients with minimal lung disease.},

By identifying infants with {CF} through a statewide neonatal screening program, we investigated whether airway inflammation was present in these infants, with the goal of furthering our understanding of the early events in this lung disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ({BALF}) from 16 infants with {CF} (mean age, 6 mo) and 11 disease control infants (mean age, 12 mo) was examined for the following inflammatory parameters: (1) neutrophil count; (2) activity of free neutrophil elastase; (3) elastase/alpha 1-antiprotease inhibitor complexes; and (4) the level of interleukin-8 ({IL}-8). We also quantified the spontaneous level of expression of {IL}-8 {mRNA} transcripts by airway macrophages. Each index of airway inflammation was increased in the {BALF} of infants with {CF} as compared with control infants. In addition, both the number of neutrophils and {IL}-8 levels were increased in infants with {CF} who had negative cultures (n = 7) for common bacterial {CF}-related pathogens, as well as for common respiratory viruses and fungi at the time of bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}). These findings suggest that airway inflammation is already present in infants with {CF} who are as young as 4 wks. Furthermore, although many different cell types (e.g., epithelial cells) may express {IL}-8, airway macrophages appear to be a source of this chemokine, and may thus play a prominent role in early neutrophil influx into the lung.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Better understanding of evolution of lung function in infants with cystic fibrosis ({CF}) and its association with pulmonary inflammation and infection is crucial in informing both early intervention studies aimed at limiting lung damage and the role of lung function as outcomes in such studies.
{OBJECTIVES}: To describe longitudinal change in lung function in infants with {CF} and its association with pulmonary infection and inflammation.
{METHODS}: Infants diagnosed after newborn screening or clinical presentation were recruited prospectively. {FVC}, forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds ({FEV}(0.5)), and forced expiratory flows at 75\% of exhaled vital capacity ({FEF}(75)) were measured using the raised-volume technique, and z-scores were calculated from published reference equations. Pulmonary infection and inflammation were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage within 48 hours of lung function testing.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Thirty-seven infants had at least two successful repeat lung function measurements. Mean ({SD}) z-scores for {FVC} were -0.8 (1.0), -0.9 (1.1), and -1.7 (1.2) when measured at the first visit, 1-year visit, or 2-year visit, respectively. Mean ({SD}) z-scores for {FEV}(0.5) were -1.4 (1.2), -2.4 (1.1), and -4.3 (1.6), respectively. In those infants in whom free neutrophil elastase was detected, {FVC} z-scores were 0.81 lower (P=0.003), and {FEV}(0.5) z-scores 0.96 lower (P=0.001), respectively. Significantly greater decline in {FEV}(0.5) z-scores occurred in those infected with Staphylococcus aureus (P=0.018) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P=0.021).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In infants with {CF}, pulmonary inflammation is associated with lower lung function, whereas pulmonary infection is associated with a greater rate of decline in lung function. Strategies targeting pulmonary inflammation and infection are required to prevent early decline in lung function in infants with {CF}.},

In 2000, the {US} {CF} National Patient Registry data showed that among 1000 infants {\textless}2 years of age, the first bacterial pathogens detected are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the prevalence of these pathogens in these young infants are 19\%, 42\%, and 29\%, respectively. In addition, 7\% harbour Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and {\textless}1\% harbour Burkholderia cepacia complex. Several investigators have performed bronchoscopy studies on young infants to further examine the natural history of lung disease. In one such study of 40 {CF} infants, 65\%, 63\% and 70\% of children at 1, 2, and 3 years of age harboured at least one {CF} pathogen. H. influenzae was most common (38\%) in infants at 1 year of age, and S. aureus was most common in 2 (37\%) and 3 (36\%) year olds. P. aeruginosa increased from 18\% at 1 year of age to 33\% at 3 years of age and was usually present in high numbers, i.e., {\textgreater} or =10(5) {CFU}/ml of {BAL} fluid. Investigators have studied the microbiology of young {CF} infants using specimens derived from the upper airway (deep throat) compared with the lower airway (broncheoalveolar lavage specimens) to determine if the upper airway is predictive of pathogens in the lower airway. In general, these studies have shown that a negative oropharyngeal culture indicated that isolation of P. aeruginosa from the lower airway was unlikely, but a positive culture did not predict lower airway infection. Similar findings were noted for H. influenzae and S. aureus.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Airway inflammation and infection are early events in cystic fibrosis ({CF}) pathogenesis. The existence of an imbalance in the immune cell population of the {CF} fetal airway before infection remains completely unknown.
{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to determine whether early signs of inflammation are observed in {CF} airways during human fetal development.
{METHODS}: Tracheas and lungs were collected from 21 {CF} and 16 non-{CF} fetuses. In tissue sections, the numbers of neutrophils, mast cells, macrophages, and B and T lymphocytes were quantitatively analyzed by means of image cytometry. The presence of {IL}-4, {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {IL}-10, {RANTES}, {IFN}-gamma, {TNF}-alpha, and {NF} kappa B and its inhibitor I kappa B-alpha was qualitatively evaluated by immunofluorescent staining.
{RESULTS}: During fetal airway development, epithelial and glandular differentiation, as well as the distribution of inflammatory markers, was similar in {CF} and non-{CF} tissues. Significant differences between {CF} and non-{CF} fetal airways were observed only in the numbers of mast cells and macrophages. In the {CF} trachea, the mast cell number increased slowly but continuously, whereas in the non-{CF} trachea this number rapidly reached a plateau. In the {CF} lung, the macrophage number increased with time, whereas in the non-{CF} lung it decreased.
{CONCLUSION}: Although no intrinsic inflammation was demonstrated, we observed a distinct appearance of mast cells and macrophages in {CF} airways in comparison with non-{CF} airways during fetal development. These 2 cell populations were greater in {CF} airways at a late stage of fetal development, suggesting their possible involvement in the early onset of inflammation in {CF} infants.},

	abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is characterized by an early and sustained influx of inflammatory cells into the airways and by release of proteases. Resolution of inflammation is normally associated with the orderly removal of dying apoptotic inflammatory cells through cell recognition receptors, such as the phosphatidylserine receptor, {CD}36, and alpha v integrins. Accordingly, removal of apoptotic inflammatory cells may be impaired in persistent inflammatory responses such as that seen in cystic fibrosis airways. Examination of sputa from cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients demonstrated an abundance of apoptotic cells, in excess of that seen in patients with chronic bronchitis. In vitro, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis airway fluid directly inhibited apoptotic cell removal by alveolar macrophages in a neutrophil elastase-dependent manner, suggesting that elastase may impair apoptotic cell clearance in vivo. Flow cytometry demonstrated that neutrophil elastase cleaved the phosphatidylserine receptor, but not {CD}36 or {CD}32 (Fc gamma {RII}). Cleavage of the phosphatidylserine receptor by neutrophil elastase specifically disrupted phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, implying a potential mechanism for delayed apoptotic cell clearance in vivo. Therefore, defective airway clearance of apoptotic cells in cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis may be due to elastase-mediated cleavage of phosphatidylserine receptor on phagocytes and may contribute to ongoing airway inflammation.},

Although macrophages from the chronically infected lungs of {CF} patients appear to be one source of {IL}-10, little or no intracellular {IL}-10 was found in bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from healthy control subjects, suggesting that there must be another source of this cytokine in healthy lungs. We found that bronchial epithelial cells from healthy control subjects constitutively produce {IL}-10, which appears to be downregulated in {CF} patients. It is thus likely that the bronchial epithelium plays an important role in regulating the local immune response, producing {IL}-10 to decrease inflammation in the healthy lung.

We found that primary cultures of human airway epithelial and cultured fetal lung explants expressed {CCL}20 {mRNA}. Expression of {CCL}20 transcripts were significantly induced by interleukin ({IL})-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inhibited by dexamethasone. Primary cultures of airway epithelia secreted {CCL}20 both apically and basolaterally, and {CCL}20 abundance was increased over 30-fold with {IL}-1beta stimulation, achieving an estimated concentration of 167 ng/ml in airway surface liquid. {CCL}20 abundance in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with cystic fibrosis was nearly 90-fold higher compared with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from healthy volunteers. Interestingly, {CCL}20 exhibited salt-sensitive antimicrobial activity, mainly against Gram-negative bacteria in low mug/ml concentrations. Additionally, apical washings from {IL}-1beta-stimulated primary cultures of human airway epithelia had significantly more antimicrobial activity than unstimulated controls. {CCL}20 rapidly permeabilized bacterial membranes with a time course intermediate to {HBD}-2 and {HBD}-3. Thus, {CCL}20 is a bi-functional peptide with both innate and adaptive immune properties that is regulated by inflammatory mediators, expressed by airway epithelia, and increased in cystic fibrosis airway secretions.},

	abstract = {A thorough understanding of the early natural history of cystic fibrosis ({CF}) lung disease is critical for the development of effective interventions in the youngest patients. We assessed the evolution of pulmonary infection, inflammation, and clinical course among 40 infants over a 2-year period through annual bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}) for culture and measurements of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, semiannual infant pulmonary function testing, and quarterly clinical evaluations. Both the prevalence of {CF} pathogens and their density in {BAL} fluid increased with age. Infants had neutrophilic lower airway inflammation and elevated {IL}-8 concentrations independent of whether {CF} pathogens were recovered. Total leukocyte and neutrophil densities and {IL}-8 concentrations increased with density of {CF} pathogens in {BAL} fluid, whether the isolated organism was P. aeruginosa or another pathogen. {IL}-10 concentrations were similar in {CF} subjects and non-{CF} historical controls. Infants generally had suboptimal growth (low weight and height percentiles) and obstructive lung disease (decreased expiratory flows and air trapping). Subjects from whom {CF} pathogens were isolated at {\textgreater} 10(5) cfu/{mL} had the worst air trapping and lowest Brasfield chest X-ray scores. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies of early intervention in {CF} lung disease, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapy.},

The present study examines endotoxin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of {CF} versus non-{CF} (N) control children, and correlates these with the inflammatory markers interleukin-8 and neutrophils. Fifty-five patients with {CF} and 56 patients without {CF} between the ages of 0.04 to 13.25 years were included. Infection, defined as a bacterial count above 50,000 cfu/ml, was present in 27 {CF} and 25 N patients. Endotoxin levels were not different between patients with and without {CF} (infected: 74.9 +/- 12.1 {EU}/ml versus 51.4 +/- 12.5 {EU}/ml, p = 0.16; noninfected: 5.9 +/- 4.8 {EU}/ml versus 11.1 +/- 4.3 {EU}/ml, p = 0.28). Endotoxin activity correlated to the number of gram-negative organisms in {CF} and N patients, and endotoxin activity per bacterial colony forming unit did not differ with various gram-negative species. Both interleukin-8 and neutrophils were positively correlated with endotoxin, but this slope was shifted toward higher levels of inflammation in {CF} patients. We conclude that it is unlikely that higher levels of endotoxin in the absence of viable bacteria explain the increased inflammatory response in {CF}.},

Furthermore, retroinhibition exerted by {PMA}-activated protein kinase C on stimulated inositol phosphates or on beta-glucuronidase exocytosis was marginal or absent in {CF} neutrophils, whereas it was significant in the case of control neutrophils.

We investigated 20 patients with cystic fibrosis, 19 individuals with bronchial asthma, and 21 healthy nonatopic subjects. Isolated granulocytes were stimulated with serum-opsonized Sephadex G15 particles and the released amounts of {ECP} and {MPO} were measured by using radioimmunoassays. Eosinophils of patients with cystic fibrosis released significantly higher amounts of {ECP} than control subjects (p {\textless} 0.0001) and individuals with bronchial asthma (p {\textless} 0.0001). The release of {MPO} from neutrophils was also higher (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p {\textless} 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, a significant relationship between clinical variables and secretory activity of eosinophils was found in cystic fibrosis. We conclude that eosinophils as well as neutrophils obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased propensity to release their granule proteins which may be due to priming mechanisms.

	abstract = {Matrix metalloproteases ({MMPs}) are proteolytic enzymes that regulate extracellular matrix turnover and aid in restoring tissue architecture following injury. There is an emerging role for extracellular matrix destruction in the pathogenesis of chronic neutrophilic lung diseases. In this study, we examined the expression and activity profiles of {MMPs} in lower airway secretions from cystic fibrosis ({CF}) patients, patients with acute respiratory failure ({ARF}), and normal controls. A discrete repertoire of {MMP} isoforms was found in the {CF} samples, with robust {MMP}-9 expression compared with normal controls and {ARF}. {CF} samples possessed increased levels of active {MMP}-9, as well as decreased amounts of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 ({TIMP}-1), a natural inhibitor of {MMP}-9. The {CF} inpatient samples demonstrated fully active {MMP}-9 activity compared with {CF} outpatients, {ARF}, and normal controls. {CF} samples also demonstrated increased human neutrophil elastase ({HNE}) levels compared with {ARF} and normal controls. To examine potential mechanisms for the protease dysregulation seen in the {CF} clinical samples, in vitro studies demonstrated that {HNE} could activate pro-{MMP}-9 and also degrade {TIMP}-1; this {HNE}-based activation, however, was not seen with {MMP}-8. A strong correlation was seen between {HNE} and {MMP}-9 activity in {CF} inpatient samples. Finally, the dysregulated {MMP}-9 activity seen in {CF} inpatient sputum samples could be significantly reduced by the use of {MMP}-9 inhibitors. Collectively, these findings further emphasize the proposed protease/antiprotease imbalance in chronic neutrophilic lung disease, providing a potential mechanism contributing to this proteolytic dysregulation.},

Our primary objective was to examine the relationship between matrix metalloproteinase-9 ({MMP}-9) and pulmonary function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ({FEV}1), in children with {CF}. We measured {MMP}-9 and its natural tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ({TIMP}-1) in induced sputum from 18 clinically stable {CF} children with normal to mildly abnormal lung function and 7 healthy control children. Measures of airway inflammation from induced sputum included cell counts and differentials, interleukin-8 ({IL}-8), neutrophil elastase, {MMP}-9, and {TIMP}-1. Infection was assessed through quantitative bacterial counts. Induced sputum levels of {MMP}-9 and {TIMP}-1 were significantly increased in children with {CF} compared with healthy controls. Also, the {MMP}-9/{TIMP}-1 molar ratio was higher in the {CF} group. Among {CF} children, there was a significant inverse relationship between {MMP}-9 and {FEV}1. In addition, sputum {MMP}-9 and {TIMP}-1 concentrations significantly correlated with total white cells and neutrophils, {IL}-8, and neutrophil elastase. Neither {MMP}-9 nor {TIMP}-1 correlated with airway infection. We conclude that clinically stable {CF} children with normal to mildly abnormal lung function have an increased burden of {MMP}-9 in their airways. The observed relationships of {MMP}-9 with lung function and other measures of airway inflammation suggest that this enzyme may be a useful marker of airway injury and airflow obstruction in persons with {CF}.},

The aim of this present study was to investigate the effects of {CF} exacerbations on the reactivity of peripheral blood neutrophils compared to data from a normal healthy control population. Peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from control subjects and {CF} patients before and after an exacerbation of their lung disease. Isolated neutrophils were stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ({fMLP}) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ({PMA}) and the rate of superoxide generation and elastase activity measured and compared with neutrophils from healthy age-matched controls. Neutrophils from {CF} patients spontaneously generated higher levels of superoxide after resolution of the exacerbation compared to control neutrophils. The stimulated generation of superoxide from control neutrophils was not significantly different from neutrophils isolated from {CF} patients either before or after resolution of the {CF} exacerbation. Neutrophils from {CF} patients spontaneously released more elastase than control neutrophils but released less elastase than control neutrophils in response to {fMLP}. The stimulated release of elastase from neutrophils was not significantly different before compared to after resolution of the exacerbation. Neutrophils from {CF} patients displayed a different pattern of response than those from control subjects; however, {CF} exacerbations did not appear to modulate neutrophil function.},

{RESULTS}: {MMP}-8 (39.3 (6.8) v 0.12 (0.01) ng/ml), {MMP}-9 (58.0 (11.4) v 0.5 (0.02) ng/ml), and the molar ratio of {MMP}-9/{TIMP}-1 (0.36 (0.05) v 0.048 (0.01)) were significantly higher in patients with {CF} than in control children without lung disease. Gelatine zymography showed the typical banding pattern of neutrophil derived {MMP}-9, including 130 {kDa} {NGAL}-{MMP}-9 complex and 92 {kDa} latent {MMP}-9 bands; 85 {kDa} bands (corresponding to active {MMP}-9) were seen in all patients.

This study assessed the relationship between levels of neutrophil apoptosis and sputum microbiology in matched clinically stable patients with {CF}.
{METHODS}: Sputum was induced from 34 patients (nine with no Gram negative infection, 10 colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 with Burkholderia cenocepacia, and five with other infections). Apoptotic neutrophils measured by flow cytometric Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and morphology were similar in all groups.
{RESULTS}: Patients infected with P aeruginosa or B cenocepacia had a significantly lower percentage of viable neutrophils in the sputum than those with no Gram negative infection (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.01, median (interquartile range ({IQR})) 14.2\% (9.4-21.6), 15.8\% (12.3-19.5), and 48.4\% (23.0-66.4); p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively).

One hypothesis is that {CF} airway surface liquid ({ASL}) is abnormal and interferes with neutrophil function. To study this possibility, we developed an in vitro system in which we collected {ASL} from primary cultures of normal and {CF} airway epithelial cells. Microbial killing was less efficient when bacteria were incubated with neutrophils in the presence of {ASL} from {CF} epithelia compared with normal {ASL}. Antimicrobial functions of human neutrophils were assessed in {ASL} from {CF} and normal epithelia using a combination of quantitative bacterial culture, flow cytometry, and microfluorescence imaging. The results of these assays of neutrophil function were indistinguishable in {CF} and normal {ASL}. In contrast, the direct bactericidal activity of {ASL} to Escherichia coli and to clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was substantially less in {CF} than in normal {ASL}, even when highly diluted in media of identical ionic strength. Together, these observations indicate that the antimicrobial properties of {ASL} in {CF} are compromised in a manner independent of ionic strength of the {ASL}, and that this effect is not mediated through a direct effect of the {ASL} on phagocyte function.},

	abstract = {Inflammation plays a critical role in lung disease progression in cystic fibrosis ({CF}). This inflammatory process is dominated by a neutrophil influx in the airways. To determine whether the accumulation of neutrophils in the airways of {CF} patients is associated with an altered function, we analyzed the capacity of neutrophils isolated from the lung compartment and the blood to release the major neutrophil pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines {IL}-8 and {IL}-1-receptor antagonist (ra) spontaneously and in the presence of {LPS}. Comparison of cytokine production by blood neutrophils from {CF} patients and from control subjects showed significantly increased {IL}-8 and decreased {IL}-1ra release by {CF} neutrophils. Comparison of cytokine production by airway and blood neutrophils from {CF} patients also documented distinct profiles: the spontaneous release of {IL}-8 and {IL}-1ra by airway neutrophils was significantly higher than that from blood neutrophils. Culture in the presence of {LPS} failed to further enhance cytokine production. Analysis of the effect of dexamethasone confirmed the difference in the responsiveness of lung and blood neutrophils in {CF}. Used at a concentration effective in reducing {IL}-8 production by blood neutrophils, dexamethasone (10(-6) M) was unable to repress secretion of {IL}-8 by airway neutrophils. In addition, comparison of cytokine production by airway neutrophils from children with {CF} and children with dyskinetic cilia syndrome also documented distinct profiles of secretion. These results are consistent with a dysregulated cytokine production by lung and blood neutrophils in {CF}. They provide support to the hypothesis that not only the {CF} genotype but also the local environment may modify the functional properties of the neutrophils.},

	doi = {10.1164/rccm.200607-1029OC},
	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: The respiratory tract is constantly exposed to airborne microorganisms. Nevertheless, normal airways remain sterile without recruiting phagocytes. This innate immune activity has been attributed to mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial polypeptides of airway surface liquid. Defective airway immunity characterizes cystic fibrosis ({CF}), a disease caused by mutations in the {CF} transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride channel. The pathophysiology of defective immunity in {CF} remains to be elucidated.
{OBJECTIVE}: We investigated the ability of non-{CF} and {CF} airway epithelia to kill bacteria through the generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}).
{METHODS}: {ROS} production and {ROS}-mediated bactericidal activity were determined on the apical surfaces of human and rat airway epithelia and on cow tracheal explants.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Dual oxidase enzyme of airway epithelial cells generated sufficient H(2)O(2) to support production of bactericidal hypothiocyanite ({OSCN}(-)) in the presence of airway surface liquid components lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate ({SCN}(-)). This {OSCN}(-) formation eliminated Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on airway mucosal surfaces, whereas it was nontoxic to the host. In contrast to normal epithelia, {CF} epithelia failed to secrete {SCN}(-), thereby rendering the oxidative antimicrobial system inactive.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data indicate a novel innate defense mechanism of airways that kills bacteria via {ROS} and suggest a new cellular and molecular basis for defective airway immunity in {CF}.},

	abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen that infects the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis, initiates host inflammatory responses through interaction with airway epithelial cells. The Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}) are a family of pathogen pattern recognition receptors that play key roles in host innate immunity. In this study we aimed to determine whether {TLRs} mediate the interaction between P. aeruginosa and airway epithelial cells. Individual murine {TLRs} ({TLR}1 to {TLR}9) and dual combinations of these {TLRs} that activate an {NF}-{kappaB}-driven luciferase reporter in response to {PAO}1 were screened in {HEK} 293 cells. {TLR}5, {TLR}2, a combination of {TLR}1 and {TLR}2, or a combination of {TLR}2 and {TLR}6 responded to {PAO}1. Another P. aeruginosa strain, strain {PAK}, activated {TLR}5 similarly, while the isogenic flagellin-deficient strain {PAK}/{fliC} and the flagellum-free bacterium Haemophilus influenzae failed to activate {TLR}5. Reverse transcription-{PCR} was used to probe the presence of multiple {TLRs} (including {TLR}5) in primary human airway epithelial cells ({HAECs}). Immunostaining with {TLR}5 antibodies showed that {TLR}5 was expressed in {HAECs} and on the apical surface of the human trachea epithelium. In {HAECs}, {PAO}1, {PAK}, and Burkholderia cepacia, but not flagellin-deficient strain {PAK}/{fliC} or a B. cepacia {fliC} mutant, activated the {NF}-{kappaB} reporter. Dominant negative {TLR}5 specifically blocked the response to P. aeruginosa but not to the response to lipoteichoic acid, a specific ligand of {TLR}2. We also determined that {MyD}88, {IRAK}, {TRAF}6, and Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), but not {TIRAP}, were involved in the {TLR}-mediated response to P. aeruginosa in {HAECs}. These findings demonstrate that the airway epithelial receptor {TLR}5 senses P. aeruginosa through its flagellin protein, which may have an important role in the initiation of the host inflammatory reaction to clear the invading pathogen.},

	abstract = {The lack of functional cystic fibrosis ({CF}) transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) in the apical membranes of {CF} airway epithelial cells abolishes {cAMP}-stimulated anion transport, and bacteria, eventually including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bind to and accumulate in the mucus. Flagellin released from P. aeruginosa triggers airway epithelial Toll-like receptor 5 and subsequent {NF}-{kappaB} signaling and production and release of proinflammatory cytokines that recruit neutrophils to the infected region. This response has been termed hyperinflammatory because so many neutrophils accumulate; a response that damages {CF} lung tissue. We first review the contradictory data both for and against the idea that epithelial cells exhibit larger-than-normal proinflammatory signaling in {CF} compared with non-{CF} cells and then review proposals that might explain how reduced {CFTR} function could activate such proinflammatory signaling. It is concluded that apparent exaggerated innate immune response of {CF} airway epithelial cells may have resulted not from direct effects of {CFTR} on cellular signaling or inflammatory mediator production but from indirect effects resulting from the absence of {CFTRs} apical membrane channel function. Thus, loss of Cl-, {HCO}3-, and glutathione secretion may lead to reduced volume and increased acidification and oxidation of the airway surface liquid. These changes concentrate proinflammatory mediators, reduce mucociliary clearance of bacteria and subsequently activate cellular signaling. Loss of apical {CFTR} will also hyperpolarize basolateral membrane potentials, potentially leading to increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], intracellular Ca2+, and {NF}-{kappaB} signaling. This hyperinflammatory effect of {CF} on intracellular Ca2+ and {NF}-{kappaB} signaling would be most prominently expressed during exposure to both P. aeruginosa and also endocrine, paracrine, or nervous agonists that activate Ca2+ signaling in the airway epithelia.},

Isogenic, polarized {CF} and control bronchial epithelial cell lines, human airway cells in primary culture, and cftr null and wild-type mice were compared. {TLRs} 1-10, {MD}2, and {MyD}88 were expressed in {CF} and normal cells. Only {TLR}2 transcription was modestly increased in {CF} as compared with normal epithelial cells following bacterial stimulation. {TLR}2 was predominantly at the apical surface of airway cells and was mobilized to cell surface in response to bacteria. {TLR}4 was present in a more basolateral distribution in airway cells, but appeared to have a limited role in epithelial responses. Lipopolysaccharide failed to activate nuclear factor-{kappaB} in these cells, and {TLR}2 dominant negative but not {TLR}4 dominant negative mutants inhibited activation by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Increased availability of {TLR}2 at the apical surfaces of {CF} epithelial cells is consistent with the increased proinflammatory responses seen in {CF} airways and suggests a selective participation of {TLRs} in the airway mucosa.},

Cystic fibrosis ({CF}) patients have chronic inflammation in which oxidative stress can be a factor.

Four cell lines were used: {CFT}1 cells [with defective {CF} transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}), {DeltaF}508 homozygous, two clones] and one of the {CFT}1 clones transfected with either normal {CFTR} ({CFTR} repleted) or beta-galactosidase. {GSH} content in the apical fluid was 55\% lower in {CFTR}-deficient cultures than in {CFTR}-repleted cells (P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, intracellular {GSH} content was similar in {CFT}1 cells and {CFTR}-repleted cells. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase activity, which degrades extracellular {GSH}, did not account for differences in apical {GSH}. Rather, {GSH} efflux of {CFTR}-deficient cells was lower than that of {CFTR}-repleted cells. These studies suggested that decreased {GSH} content in the apical fluid in {CF} resulted from abnormal {GSH} transport associated with a defective {CFTR}.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the cystic fibrosis ({CF}) transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) protein modulates epithelial reduced glutathione ({GSH}) transport and when defective creates an antioxidant imbalance. To test whether the {CFTR} protein modulates lung antioxidant defenses in vivo, epithelial lining fluid ({ELF}) and lung tissue from {CFTR} knockout ({CFTR}-{KO}) and wild-type ({WT}) mice were compared for {GSH} content and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase. In the {CFTR}-{KO} mice, the {ELF} concentration of {GSH} was decreased (51\%) compared with that in {WT} mice. The concentration of {GSH} in the lung tissue of {CFTR}-{KO} mice, however, was not significantly different from that in {WT} mice. The activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase in the lung tissue of {CFTR}-{KO} mice were significantly increased compared with those in {WT} mice (48 and 28\%, respectively). Tissue lipid and {DNA} oxidation were evaluated by measurement of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, respectively. The levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in the lung tissue of {CFTR}-{KO} mice were significantly increased compared with those in {WT} mice.

Genes were selected from Affymetrix Murine Gene-Chips analysis and subjected to functional classification, k-means clustering, promoter cis-elements/modules searching, literature mining, and pathway exploring. Genomic responses to Cftr-/- were not corrected by expression of {CFTR}(delta508). Genes regulating host defense, inflammation, fluid and electrolyte transport were similarly altered in Cftr-/- and {CFTR}(delta508) mice. {CFTR}(delta508) induced a primary disturbance in expression of genes regulating redox and antioxidant systems. Genomic responses to {CFTR}(tg) were modest and were not associated with lung pathology. {CFTR}(tg) and {CFTR}(delta508) induced genes encoding heat shock proteins and other chaperones but did not activate the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. {RNAs} encoding proteins that directly interact with {CFTR} were identified in each of the {CFTR} mouse models, supporting the hypothesis that {CFTR} functions within a multiprotein complex whose members interact at the level of protein-protein interactions and gene expression.

We have investigated a group of infants and young children with {CF} to establish whether oxidants are produced in their airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ({BALF}) was assayed for myeloperoxidase as a measure of neutrophilic inflammation, and 3-chlorotyrosine as a biomarker of the potent oxidant hypochlorous acid, which is formed by myeloperoxidase. Protein carbonyls were also measured as a nonspecific indicator of reactive oxidant production. Myeloperoxidase and 3-chlorotyrosine levels in {BALF} from children with {CF} were 10- and fivefold higher, respectively, than in disease control subjects. There was a strong correlation between myeloperoxidase and 3-chlorotyrosine. Myeloperoxidase levels were fourfold higher in children with infections in their airways. Median protein carbonyls were elevated by only twofold compared with disease control subjects, but some children had extremely high levels of protein oxidation. We conclude that hypochlorous acid is produced early in {CF} and that it is a candidate for precipitating the fatal decline in lung function associated with this disease. Also, there must be other sourcesof oxidants because protein carbonyls were not related to either inflammation or infection.},

Defects in {CFTR} also perturb regulation of several intracellular signaling pathways including signal transducers and activator of transcription, I-{kappaB} and nuclear factor-kappa B, and low molecular weight {GTPases}. Together, these abnormalities result in excessive production of {NF}-{kappaB} dependent cytokines such as interleukin ({IL})-1, tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}), {IL}-6, and {IL}-8. There are decreased responses to interferon gamma and transforming growth factor beta leading to decreased production of {iNOS} and {NO}. Abnormalities of lipid mediators and decreased secretion of counter/regulatory cytokines have also been reported.

	abstract = {Dysregulated inflammation has been implicated in cystic fibrosis ({CF}) airway pathophysiology. The expression of inflammatory genes, like interleukin 8 ({IL}8), involves chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation. Inflammatory gene hyperacetylation could explain inflammatory mediator dysregulation seen in {CF} airways. {CF} airways are exposed to high levels of oxidative stress, and oxidative stress increases histone acetylation and inflammatory gene transcription. Loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) may even reduce protection against oxidative stress. Consequently, increasing oxidative stress would likely lead to an imbalance of histone acetyl-transferase ({HAT}) and deacetylase ({HDAC}) stoichiometry and contribute to the heightened inflammatory response seen in the {CF} airway. We hypothesize that oxidative stress in {CF} airways causes increased acetylation of inflammatory gene promoters, contributing to transcriptional activity of these loci. Messenger {RNA} levels of {IL}8, {IL}6, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}2, {CXCL}3, and {IL}1 are significantly elevated in {CF} epithelial cell models. Histone H4 acetylation is lower at the {IL}8 promoter of the non-{CF} cell lines than the {CF} models. The reducing agent N-acetyl-cysteine decreases {IL}8 message and promoter H4 acetylation to non-{CF} levels, suggesting that oxidative stress contributes to {IL}8 expression in these models. H(2)O(2) treatment causes increased {IL}-8 acetylation and {mRNA} in all cells, but less in the {CF}-model cells. Together these data suggest a model in which cells without functional {CFTR} are under increased oxidative stress. Our data suggest intrinsic alterations in the {HAT}/{HDAC} balance in {CFTR}-deficient cells, and that oxidative stress contributes to this alteration.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is an increase in the reduction potential or a large decrease in the reducing capacity of the cellular redox couples. A particularly destructive aspect of oxidative stress is the production of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), which include free radicals and peroxides. Some of the less reactive of these species can be converted by oxidoreduction reactions with transition metals into more aggressive radical species that can cause extensive cellular damage. In animals, {ROS} may influence cell proliferation, cell death (either apoptosis or necrosis) and the expression of genes, and may be involved in the activation of several signalling pathways, activating cell signalling cascades, such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinases. Most of these oxygen-derived species are produced at a low level by normal aerobic metabolism and the damage they cause to cells is constantly repaired. The cellular redox environment is preserved by enzymes and antioxidants that maintain the reduced state through a constant input of metabolic energy. This review summarizes current studies that have been regarding the production of {ROS} and the general redox-sensitive targets of cell signalling cascades.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is a component of diseases and degenerative processes associated with aging. However, no means are available to assess causative oxidative events separately from decline in function of protective antioxidant systems. Previous studies show that ongoing oxidative processes maintain plasma cysteine/cystine redox at a value that is more oxidized than the antioxidant glutathione/glutathione disulfide ({GSH}/{GSSG}) system, suggesting that redox analysis of these plasma thiols could allow separate evaluation of an increase in oxidative events from a decline in antioxidant function. The present study uses measurement of cysteine/cystine and {GSH}/{GSSG} redox in plasma of 122 healthy individuals aged 19-85 years to determine whether thiol-disulfide redox changes occur with age. The results show a linear oxidation of cysteine/cystine redox state with age at a rate of 0.16 {mV}/year over the entire age span. In contrast, {GSH}/{GSSG} redox was not oxidized prior to 45 years and subsequently was oxidized at a nearly linear rate of 0.7 {mV}/year. These data suggest that there is a continuous, linear increase in oxidative events throughout adult life but that the capacity of the {GSH} antioxidant system is maintained until 45 years and then declines rapidly. The data further suggest that redox states of cysteine/cystine and {GSH}/{GSSG} provide an approach to clinically distinguish between increased causative oxidative events and decreased {GSH} antioxidant function. In principle, such analyses can be used to assess efficacy of intervention strategies against oxidative stress prior to or early after onset of clinical symptoms in aging and age-related disease.},

	doi = {10.1096/fj.03-0971fje},
	abstract = {Redox mechanisms function in control of gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, but the circuitry for redox signaling remains unclear. Cysteine and methionine are the only amino acids in proteins that undergo reversible oxidation/reduction under biologic conditions and, as such, provide a means for control of protein activity, protein-protein interaction, protein trafficking, and protein-{DNA} interaction. Hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) provide a mechanism to oxidize signaling proteins. However, oxidation of sulfur-containing side chains of cysteine and methionine by {ROS} can result in oxidation states of sulfur (e.g., sulfinate, sulfonate, sulfone) that are not reducible under biologic conditions. Thus, mechanisms for oxidation that protect against over-oxidation of these susceptible residues and prevent irreversible loss of activity would be advantageous. The present study shows that the steady-state redox potential of the cysteine/cystine couple (Eh = -145 {mV}) in cells is sufficiently oxidized ({\textgreater}90 {mV}) relative to the {GSH}/{GSSG} (-250 {mV}) and thioredoxin (Trx1, -280 {mV}) redox couples for the cysteine/cystine couple to function as an oxidant in redox switching. Consequently, the cysteine/cystine couple provides a means to oxidize proteins without direct involvement of more potent oxidants. A circuitry model incorporating cysteine as a redox node, along with Trx1 and {GSH}, reveals how selective interactions between the different thiol/disulfide couples and reactive protein thiols could differentially regulate metabolic functions. Moreover, inclusion of cysteine/cystine as a signaling node distinct from {GSH} and Trx1 significantly expands the redox range over which protein thiol/disulfide couples may operate to control physiologically relevant processes.},

In the present paper, we describe a mechanism by which oxidizing extracellular environments, as maintained by the cysteine/cystine (Cys/{CySS}) redox couple, induce mitochondria-derived {ROS} (reactive oxygen species) generation and cause the activation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2), inducing an antioxidant response. {NIH} 3T3 cells were cultured in medium with extracellular Cys/{CySS} redox potentials (Eh), ranging from 0 to -150 {mV}. Cellular and mitochondrial {ROS} production significantly increased in cells incubated under more oxidizing extracellular conditions (0 and -46 {mV}). Trx2 (thioredoxin-2) is a mitochondrial-specific oxidoreductase and antioxidant and became oxidized in cells incubated at 0 or -46 {mV}. {MEFs} (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) from Trx2-overexpressing transgenic (Trx2 Tg) mice produced less intracellular {ROS} compared with {WT} (wild-type) {MEFs} at the more oxidizing extracellular conditions. Nrf2 activity was increased in {WT} {MEFs} at the 0 or -46 {mV} conditions, but was inhibited in Trx2 Tg {MEFs} under the same conditions. Furthermore, Nrf2-regulated gene expression was significantly increased in the {WT} {MEFs}, but not in the Trx2 Tg {MEFs}. These results show that the Cys/{CySS} redox status in the extracellular compartment regulates intracellular {ROS} generated primarily in the mitochondria, which play an important role in the activation of Nrf2 and up-regulation of antioxidant and detoxification systems.},

{METHODS}: The {hRPE} cells were incubated in culture medium with E(h) established over the range of -16 {mV} (most oxidized) to -158 {mV} (most reduced) by adding different concentrations of Cys and cystine ({CySS}) with constant total Cys equivalents. Apoptosis was induced with tert-butylhydroperoxide ({tBH}).
{RESULTS}: The {hRPE} cells were sensitized to {tBH}-induced apoptosis in the more oxidized extracellular conditions (E(h) {\textgreater} -55 {mV}) compared with the reduced conditions (E(h) {\textless} -89 {mV}). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase 3 after {tBH} treatments all increased under the more oxidized conditions. However, the extracellular redox state did not affect expression of Fas or {FasL} in {hRPE} cells.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {hRPE} cells that are exposed to a more oxidized extracellular redox environment have increased susceptibility to oxidant-induced apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, which could contribute to an age-related decline in cell populations in the retina and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the degenerative changes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration ({ARMD}).},

Because rotenone specifically inhibits {NADH} dehydrogenase, [{NADH}: (acceptor) oxidoreductase, {EC} 1.6.99.3], which is the enzyme of energy-conserving site 1 of the mitochondrial electron transport system, activity and kinetics of this enzyme system were studied in fibroblast homogenates. {NADH} dehydrogenase activity was equal in cells from the three genotypes.

Our objective was to determine whether the concentration of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (oh8dG), a marker of free radical-induced {DNA} damage, is elevated in {CF} patients and to correlate its excretion with clinical status. The first morning void of urine was collected from 13 {CF} patients and 10 control children of similar age. To determine clinical status, forced expiratory volume ({FEV}1) and forced ventilatory capacity ({FVC}) and a Taussing-Schwachman score were obtained for each patient. Urinary oh8dG was measured by high performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}) with electrochemical detection and the concentration normalized against creatinine concentration. The mean concentration (+/- {SD}) of urinary oh8dG was significantly higher in the {CF} group (2.78 +/- 1.21 vs. 1.51 +/- 0.38 nmol/mmol creatinine). A significant positive correlation was found between urinary oh8dG concentration and plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration in the {CF} patients (r = 0.947, p = 0.0001), suggesting that vitamin E might be involved in the excretion of oh8dG. However, no correlation was found between urinary oh8dG in {CF} and markers of lung function or the qualitative index of clinical status. These results confirm that patients with {CF} are susceptible to oxidative-induced {DNA} damage, although this appears to be independent of clinical status. Increased {DNA} damage may explain, in part, why {CF} patients have a higher incidence of malignancy compared to normal healthy age-matched controls.},

	abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a fatal genetic disorder involving dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein ({CFTR}) resulting in progressive respiratory failure. Previous studies indicate that {CFTR} regulates cellular glutathione ({GSH}) transport and that dysfunctional {CFTR} is associated with chronic pulmonary oxidative stress. The cause and the source of this oxidative stress remain unknown. The current study examines the role of the mitochondria in {CFTR}-mediated pulmonary oxidative stress. Mitochondrial {GSH} levels and markers of {DNA} and protein oxidation were assessed in the lung mitochondria from {CFTR}-knockout mice. In addition, in vitro models using human {CFTR}-sufficient and -deficient lung epithelial cells were also employed. Mitochondrial {GSH} levels were found to be decreased up to 85\% in {CFTR}-knockout mice, and 43\% in human lung epithelial cells deficient in {CFTR}. A concomitant 29\% increase in the oxidation of mitochondrial {DNA}, and a 30\% loss of aconitase activity confirmed the existence of a mitochondrial oxidative stress. Flow cytometry revealed significantly elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) in {CFTR}-deficient human lung cells. These studies suggest that dysfunctional {CFTR} leads to an increase in the level of {ROS} and mitochondrial oxidative stress. This oxidative stress, however, appears to be a consequence of lower mitochondrial {GSH} levels and not increased oxidation of {GSH}. Further studies are needed to determine how {CFTR} deficiency contributes to mitochondrial oxidative stress and the role this plays in {CFTR}-mediated lung pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Cystic fibrosis ({CF}), a multisystem disease caused by {CFTR} (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene mutations, is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response and compromised redox homeostasis in the airways. Recent evidence suggests that dysfunctional {CFTR} leads to redox imbalance and to mitochondrial reduced glutathione ({mtGSH}) depletion in {CF} models. This study was designed to investigate the consequences of {mtGSH} depletion on mitochondrial function and inflammatory response. {mtGSH} depletion was confirmed in colonic epithelium of {CFTR}-null mice and in {CFTR}-mutated human epithelial cells. {GSH} uptake experiments performed on isolated mitochondria suggest that {mtGSH} depletion is not due to a defective {GSH} transport capacity by {CF} mitochondria, despite the decreased expression of two {mtGSH} carriers, oxoglutarate carrier and dicarboxylate carrier. {CM}-H(2){DCFDA} [5 (and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester] fluorescence and aconitase activity showed an increase in reactive oxygen species levels in {CFTR}-defective cells and a pro-oxidative environment within {CF} mitochondria. The activities of respiratory chain complexes were further examined. Results showed a selective loss of Complex I ({CI}) function in {CF} models associated with an altered mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)). {CI} analysis showed normal expression but an overoxidation of its {NADH}-ubiquinone oxidoreductase Fe-S protein 1 subunit. {GSH} monoethyl ester ({GSH}-{EE}) significantly enhanced {mtGSH} levels in the {IB}3-1/C38 model and reversed {CI} inhibition, suggesting that {mtGSH} depletion is responsible for the loss of {CI} activity. Furthermore, {GSH}-{EE} attenuated Δψ(m) depolarization and restored normal {IL}-8 secretion by {CFTR}-defective cells. These studies provide evidence for a critical role of a {mtGSH} defect in mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal {IL}-8 secretion in {CF} cells and reveal the therapeutic potential of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in {CF}.},

	abstract = {Chloride anion is essential for myeloperoxidase ({MPO}) to produce hypochlorous acid ({HOCl}) in polymorphonuclear neutrophils ({PMNs}). To define whether chloride availability to {PMNs} affects their {HOCl} production and microbicidal capacity, we examined how extracellular chloride concentration affects killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ({PsA}) by normal neutrophils. {PMN}-mediated bacterial killing was strongly dependent on extracellular chloride concentration. Neutrophils in a chloride-deficient medium killed {PsA} poorly. However, as the chloride level was raised, the killing efficiency increased in a dose-dependent manner. By using specific inhibitors to selectively block {NADPH} oxidase, {MPO}, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) functions, neutrophil-mediated killing of {PsA} could be attributed to three distinct mechanisms: {CFTR}-dependent and oxidant-dependent; chloride-dependent but not {CFTR}- and oxidant-dependent; and independent of any of the tested factors. Therefore, chloride anion is involved in oxidant- and nonoxidant-mediated bacterial killing. We previously reported that neutrophils from {CF} patients are defective in chlorination of ingested bacteria, suggesting that the chloride channel defect might impair the {MPO}-hydrogen peroxide-chloride microbicidal function. Here, we compared the competence of killing {PsA} by neutrophils from normal donors and {CF} patients. The data demonstrate that the killing rate by {CF} neutrophils was significantly lower than that by normal neutrophils. {CF} neutrophils in a chloride-deficient environment had only one-third of the bactericidal capacity of normal neutrophils in a physiological chloride environment. These results suggest that {CFTR}-dependent chloride anion transport contributes significantly to killing {PsA} by normal neutrophils and when defective as in {CF}, may compromise the ability to clear {PsA}.},

	abstract = {The unfolded protein response ({UPR}) is a cellular recovery mechanism activated by endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) stress. The {UPR} is coordinated with the {ER}-associated degradation ({ERAD}) to regulate the protein load at the {ER}. In the present study, we tested how membrane protein biogenesis is regulated through the {UPR} in epithelia, using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) as a model. Pharmacological methods such as proteasome inhibition and treatment with brefeldin A and tunicamycin were used to induce {ER} stress and activate the {UPR} as monitored by increased levels of spliced {XBP}1 and {BiP} {mRNA}. The results indicate that activation of the {UPR} is followed by a significant decrease in genomic {CFTR} {mRNA} levels without significant changes in the {mRNA} levels of another membrane protein, the transferrin receptor. We also tested whether overexpression of a wild-type {CFTR} transgene in epithelia expressing endogenous wild-type {CFTR} activated the {UPR}. Although {CFTR} maturation is inefficient in this setting, the {UPR} was not activated. However, pharmacological induction of {ER} stress in these cells also led to decreased endogenous {CFTR} {mRNA} levels without affecting recombinant {CFTR} message levels. These results demonstrate that under {ER} stress conditions, endogenous {CFTR} biogenesis is regulated by the {UPR} through alterations in {mRNA} levels and posttranslationally by {ERAD}, whereas recombinant {CFTR} expression is regulated only by {ERAD}.},

	abstract = {In cystic fibrosis ({CF}) patients, pulmonary inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and may precede bacterial colonization. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic inflammation in cystic fibrosis airways. Using different cystic fibrosis cell models, we first demonstrated that, beside a high constitutive nuclear factor of {kappaB} ({NF}-{kappaB}) activity, {CF} cells showed a higher activator protein-1 ({AP}-1) activity as compared to their respective control cells. Gene expression profiles, confirmed by {RT}-{PCR} and {ELISA}, showed over-expression of numerous {NF}-{kappaB} and {AP}-1-dependent pro-inflammatory genes in {CF} cells in comparison with control cells. Activation of {NF}-{kappaB} was correlated with higher inhibitor of {kappaB} kinase ({IKK}) activity. In addition, Bio-plex phosphoprotein assays revealed higher extracellular signal-regulated kinase ({ERK}) phosphorylation in {CFT}-2 cells. Inhibition of this kinase strongly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes coding for growth-regulated proteins (Gro-alpha, Gro-beta and Gro-gamma) and interleukins ({IL}-1beta, {IL}-6 and {IL}-8). Moreover, inhibition of secreted interleukin-1beta ({IL}-1beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor ({bFGF}) with neutralizing antibodies reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. Our data thus demonstrated for the first time that the absence of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) at the plasma membrane leads to an intrinsic {AP}-1, in addition to {NF}-{kappaB}, activity and consequently to a pro-inflammatory state sustained through autocrine factors such as {IL}-1beta and {bFGF}.},

We found that {LPS}-induced neutrophilic lung inflammation was exaggerated in {EC}-{SOD}-deficient mice and diminished in mice that overexpressed {EC}-{SOD} specifically in the lung. Similar patterns were seen for bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, keratinocyte-derived chemokines, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 as well as expression of lung intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, endothelial cell selectin, and platelet selectin. In a macrophage cell line, {EC}-{SOD} inhibited {LPS}-induced macrophage cytokine release, but did not alter expression of intercellular adhesion molecules in endothelial cells.

We have previously shown that in some but not all {FALS} pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between {FALS} and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase ({SOD}1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated {SOD}1 as a candidate gene in {FALS}.

Mice lacking {MnSOD} develop cardiomyopathy and basal ganglia lesions, have no lipid peroxidation products, but show destruction of enzymes with 4Fe-4S centres. Patients with complex I ({NADH}-{CoQ} oxidoreductase) deficiency show variable hyperinduction of {MnSOD} that is at least partially dependent on the extent of disturbance of redox state. This in turn appears to result in production of excess hydroxyl radicals, which are damaging to proteins, lipids and {DNA}. An alternative method of protection from oxygen radicals is employed by complex I-deficient cell types that do not induce {MnSOD} in that they show induction of the bcl-2 protein.},

Animal and in vitro studies indicate that {ROS} can reproduce many of the features of asthma. The ability of {ROS} to produce the clinical features of asthma may depend on an individual's lung antioxidant defenses. Patients with asthma are reported to have reduced antioxidant defenses in peripheral blood, but little is known about the antioxidant defenses of their lung cells. To define lung cell antioxidant defenses in asthma, the glutathione concentration and the glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase ({SOD}) activities were measured in cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL} cells) and by bronchial brushing (bronchial epithelial cells, {HBEC}) from normal subjects and patients with asthma. Superoxide dismutase activity was reduced 25\% in {BAL} cells (p {\textless} .05) and nearly 50\% in {HBEC} (p {\textless} .02) from patients with asthma. Alterations in the other antioxidants were not identified. A direct relationship was found between airway reactivity to methacholine, measured as {PC}(20){FEV}(1), and {HBEC} {SOD} activity (r2 = 89; p {\textless} .005), but not between airway reactivity and the other antioxidants. The finding of reduced {SOD} activity in lung cells of patients with asthma suggests that diminished {SOD} activity serves as a marker of the inflammation characterizing asthma.

The ratio between the maximal stimulation and depression observed was around 30-fold. The responses were generally slow and developed over periods of several days. There were no effects of {IFN}-alpha, {IL}-2, {IL}-3, {IL}-4, {IL}-6, {IL}-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, human growth hormone, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, leukotriene B4, prostaglandin E2, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, platelet-activating factor, and indomethacin. The cytokines influencing the {EC}-{SOD} expression are also known to influence superoxide production by leukocytes and other cell types, and the {EC}-{SOD} response pattern is roughly compatible with the notion that its function is to protect cells against extracellular superoxide radicals. The results show that {EC}-{SOD} is a participant in the complex inflammatory response orchestrated by cytokines. The {CuZn}-{SOD} activity of the fibroblasts was not influenced by any of the cytokines, whereas the Mn-{SOD} activity was depressed by {TGF}-beta. {TNF}-alpha, {IL}-1 alpha, and {IFN}-gamma stimulated the Mn-{SOD} activity, as previously known, and these responses were reduced by {TGF}-beta.
