abstract = {Various approaches have explored the covariation of residues in multiple-sequence alignments of homologous proteins to extract functional and structural information. Among those are principal component analysis (PCA), which identifies the most correlated groups of residues, and direct coupling analysis (DCA), a global inference method based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims at predicting residue-residue contacts. In this paper, inspired by the statistical physics of disordered systems, we introduce the Hopfield-Potts model to naturally interpolate between these two approaches. The Hopfield-Potts model allows us to identify relevant 'patterns' of residues from the knowledge of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the residue-residue correlation matrix. We show how the computation of such statistical patterns makes it possible to accurately predict residue-residue contacts with a much smaller number of parameters than DCA. This dimensional reduction allows us to avoid overfitting and to extract contact information from multiple-sequence alignments of reduced size. In addition, we show that low-eigenvalue correlation modes, discarded by PCA, are important to recover structural information: the corresponding patterns are highly localized, that is, they are concentrated in few sites, which we find to be in close contact in the three-dimensional protein fold.},

abstract = {Network analysis is entering fields where network structures are unknown, such as psychology and the educational sciences. A crucial step in the application of network models lies in the assessment of network structure. Current methods either have serious drawbacks or are only suitable for Gaussian data. In the present paper, we present a method for assessing network structures from binary data. Although models for binary data are infamous for their computational intractability, we present a computationally efficient model for estimating network structures. The approach, which is based on Ising models as used in physics, combines logistic regression with model selection based on a Goodness-of-Fit measure to identify relevant relationships between variables that define connections in a network. A validation study shows that this method succeeds in revealing the most relevant features of a network for realistic sample sizes. We apply our proposed method to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms from symptom scores of 1108 subjects. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal in cellular signaling is to understand allosteric communication, the process by which signals originating at one site in a protein propagate reliably to affect distant functional sites. The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Here, we describe a sequence-based statistical method for quantitatively mapping the global network of amino acid interactions in a protein. Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein-coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

abstract = {Protein folding has been a major area of research for many years. Nonetheless, the mechanisms leading to the formation of an active biological fold are still not fully apprehended. The huge amount of available sequence and structural information provides hints to identify the putative fold for a given sequence. Indeed, protein structures prefer a limited number of local backbone conformations, some being characterized by preferences for certain amino acids. These preferences largely depend on the local structural environment. The prediction of local backbone conformations has become an important factor to correctly identifying the global protein fold. Here, we review the developments in the field of local structure prediction and especially their implication in protein fold recognition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of the residues in protein-protein interaction sites has a significant impact in problems such as drug discovery. Motivated by the observation that the set of interface residues of a protein tend to be conserved even among remote structural homologs, we introduce PrISE, a family of local structural similarity-based computational methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues.\n\nRESULTS: We present a novel representation of the surface residues of a protein in the form of structural elements. Each structural element consists of a central residue and its surface neighbors. The PrISE family of interface prediction methods uses a representation of structural elements that captures the atomic composition and accessible surface area of the residues that make up each structural element. Each of the members of the PrISE methods identifies for each structural element in the query protein, a collection of similar structural elements in its repository of structural elements and weights them according to their similarity with the structural element of the query protein. PrISEL relies on the similarity between structural elements (i.e. local structural similarity). PrISEG relies on the similarity between protein surfaces (i.e. general structural similarity). PrISEC, combines local structural similarity and general structural similarity to predict interface residues. These predictors label the central residue of a structural element in a query protein as an interface residue if a weighted majority of the structural elements that are similar to it are interface residues, and as a non-interface residue otherwise. The results of our experiments using three representative benchmark datasets show that the PrISEC outperforms PrISEL and PrISEG; and that PrISEC is highly competitive with state-of-the-art structure-based methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. Our comparison of PrISEC with PredUs, a recently developed method for predicting interface residues of a query protein based on the known interface residues of its (global) structural homologs, shows that performance superior or comparable to that of PredUs can be obtained using only local surface structural similarity. PrISEC is available as a Web server at http://prise.cs.iastate.edu/\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Local surface structural similarity based methods offer a simple, efficient, and effective approach to predict protein-protein interface residues.},

We examined the properties of four different methods for detecting these correlated mutations. On both simple, artificial alignments and real alignments from the Pfam database, we found a surprising lack of agreement between the four correlated mutation methods. We argue that these differences are caused in part by differing sensitivities to background conservation.

@article{Sippl1990,
abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This apprach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a ??-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an ??-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of ??-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of ??-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of ??-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extentions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems. ?? 1990 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. RESULTS An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff > -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD. CONCLUSION The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations.

abstract = {Recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting residue-residue contacts in protein 3D structures using evolutionary covariance information. However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90%) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure. These conditions are currently met by 422 of the protein families collected in the Pfam database.},

The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures are represented by bundles of conformers calculated from different randomized initial structures using identical experimental input data. The spread among these conformers indicates the precision of the atomic coordinates. However, there is as yet no reliable measure of structural accuracy, i.e.; how close NMR conformers are to the "true" structure. Instead, the precision of structure bundles is widely (mis)interpreted as a measure of structural quality. Attempts to increase precision often overestimate accuracy by tight bundles of high precision but much lower accuracy. To overcome this problem, we introduce a protocol for NMR structure determination with the software package CYANA, which produces, like the traditional method, bundles of conformers in agreement with a common set of conformational restraints but with a realistic precision that is, throughout a variety of proteins and NMR data sets, a much better estimate of structural accuracy than the precision of conventional structure bundles.},

abstract = {Bayesian approaches for single-variable and group-structured sparsity outperform L1 regularization, but are challenging to apply to large, potentially intractable models. Here we show how noncentered parameterizations, a common trick for improving the efficiency of exact inference in hierarchical models, can similarly improve the accuracy of variational approximations. We develop this with two contributions: First, we introduce Fadeout, an approach for variational inference that uses noncentered parameterizations to capture a posteriori correlations between parameters and hyperparameters. Second, we extend stochastic variational inference to undirected models, enabling efficient hierarchical Bayes without approximations of intractable normalizing constants. We find that this framework substantially improves inferences of undirected graphical models under both sparse and group-sparse priors.},

abstract = {The network of native non-covalent residue contacts determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein. However, not all contacts are of equal structural significance, and little knowledge exists about a minimal, yet sufficient, subset required to define the global features of a protein. Characterisation of this "structural essence" has remained elusive so far: no algorithmic strategy has been devised to-date that could outperform a random selection in terms of 3D reconstruction accuracy (measured as the Ca RMSD). It is not only of theoretical interest (i.e., for design of advanced statistical potentials) to identify the number and nature of essential native contacts-such a subset of spatial constraints is very useful in a number of novel experimental methods (like EPR) which rely heavily on constraint-based protein modelling. To derive accurate three-dimensional models from distance constraints, we implemented a reconstruction pipeline using distance geometry. We selected a test-set of 12 protein structures from the four major SCOP fold classes and performed our reconstruction analysis. As a reference set, series of random subsets (ranging from 10% to 90% of native contacts) are generated for each protein, and the reconstruction accuracy is computed for each subset. We have developed a rational strategy, termed "cone-peeling" that combines sequence features and network descriptors to select minimal subsets that outperform the reference sets. We present, for the first time, a rational strategy to derive a structural essence of residue contacts and provide an estimate of the size of this minimal subset. Our algorithm computes sparse subsets capable of determining the tertiary structure at approximately 4.8 A Ca RMSD with as little as 8% of the native contacts (Ca-Ca and Cb-Cb). At the same time, a randomly chosen subset of native contacts needs about twice as many contacts to reach the same level of accuracy. This "structural essence" opens new avenues in the fields of structure prediction, empirical potentials and docking.},

abstract = {What conformations do protein molecules populate in solution? Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all < 2.5 ?? C??RMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The accurate prediction of residue-residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA.\n\nRESULTS: PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation >23) was ≥ 0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.\n\nAVAILABILITY: The PSICOV source code can be downloaded from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies have suggested relationships between the size, stability and topology of a protein fold and the rate and mechanisms by which it is achieved. The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 {\AA} C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although homology-based methods are among the most widely used methods for predicting the structure and function of proteins, the question as to whether interface sequence conservation can be effectively exploited in predicting protein-protein interfaces has been a subject of debate. RESULTS: We studied more than 300,000 pair-wise alignments of protein sequences from structurally characterized protein complexes, including both obligate and transient complexes. We identified sequence similarity criteria required for accurate homology-based inference of interface residues in a query protein sequence.Based on these analyses, we developed HomPPI, a class of sequence homology-based methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. We present two variants of HomPPI: (i) NPS-HomPPI (Non partner-specific HomPPI), which can be used to predict interface residues of a query protein in the absence of knowledge of the interaction partner; and (ii) PS-HomPPI (Partner-specific HomPPI), which can be used to predict the interface residues of a query protein with a specific target protein.Our experiments on a benchmark dataset of obligate homodimeric complexes show that NPS-HomPPI can reliably predict protein-protein interface residues in a given protein, with an average correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.76, sensitivity of 0.83, and specificity of 0.78, when sequence homologs of the query protein can be reliably identified. NPS-HomPPI also reliably predicts the interface residues of intrinsically disordered proteins. Our experiments suggest that NPS-HomPPI is competitive with several state-of-the-art interface prediction servers including those that exploit the structure of the query proteins. The partner-specific classifier, PS-HomPPI can, on a large dataset of transient complexes, predict the interface residues of a query protein with a specific target, with a CC of 0.65, sensitivity of 0.69, and specificity of 0.70, when homologs of both the query and the target can be reliably identified. The HomPPI web server is available at http://homppi.cs.iastate.edu/. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence homology-based methods offer a class of computationally efficient and reliable approaches for predicting the protein-protein interface residues that participate in either obligate or transient interactions. For query proteins involved in transient interactions, the reliability of interface residue prediction can be improved by exploiting knowledge of putative interaction partners.},

Historically, crystallographers have had limited success using NMR structures as MR search models. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of the utility of protein NMR ensembles as MR search models, using data for 25 pairs of X-ray and NMR structures solved and refined using modern NMR methods. Starting from NMR ensembles prepared by an improved protocol, FindCore, correct MR solutions were obtained for 22 targets. Based on these solutions, automatic model rebuilding could be done successfully. Rosetta refinement of NMR structures provided MR solutions for another two proteins. We also demonstrate that such properly prepared NMR ensembles and X-ray crystal structures have similar performance when used as MR search models for homologous structures, particularly for targets with sequence identity >40%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scoring functions, such as molecular mechanic forcefields and statistical potentials are fundamentally important tools in protein structure modeling and quality assessment. RESULTS: The performances of a number of publicly available scoring functions are compared with a statistical rigor, with an emphasis on knowledge-based potentials. We explored the effect on accuracy of alternative choices for representing interaction center types and other features of scoring functions, such as using information on solvent accessibility, on torsion angles, accounting for secondary structure preferences and side chain orientation. Partially based on the observations made, we present a novel residue based statistical potential, which employs a shuffled reference state definition and takes into account the mutual orientation of residue side chains. Atom- and residue-level statistical potentials and Linux executables to calculate the energy of a given protein proposed in this work can be downloaded from http://www.fiserlab.org/potentials. CONCLUSIONS: Among the most influential terms we observed a critical role of a proper reference state definition and the benefits of including information about the microenvironment of interaction centers. Molecular mechanical potentials were also tested and found to be over-sensitive to small local imperfections in a structure, requiring unfeasible long energy relaxation before energy scores started to correlate with model quality.},

abstract = {Profile analysis is a method for detecting distantly related proteins by sequence comparison. The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences.},

These include blind test projects such as the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) and the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Determination by NMR (CASD-NMR). An important aim is to establish structure validation criteria that can reliably assess the accuracy of a new protein structure. Various quality measures derived from the coordinates have been proposed. A universal structural quality assessment method should combine multiple individual scores in a meaningful way, which is challenging because of their different measurement units. Here we present a method based on a generalized linear model (GLM) that combines diverse protein structure quality scores into a single quantity with intuitive meaning, namely the predicted coordinate RMSD value between the present structure and the (unavailable) "true" structure (GLM-RMSD). For two sets of structural models from the CASD-NMR and CASP projects this GLM-RMSD value was compared to the actual accuracy given by the RMSD value to the corresponding, experimentally determined reference structure from the PDB. The correlation coefficients between actual (model vs. reference from PDB) and predicted (model vs. "true") heavy-atom RMSDs were 0.69 and 0.76, for the two datasets from CASD-NMR and CASP, respectively, which is considerably higher than those for the individual scores (-0.24-0.68). The GLM-RMSD can thus predict the accuracy of protein structures more reliably than individual coordinate-based quality scores.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding and function is one of the most important problems in biological research. Energy landscape theory and the folding funnel concept have provided a framework to investigate the mechanisms associated to these processes. Since protein energy landscapes are in most cases minimally frustrated, structure based models (SMBs) have successfully determined the geometrical features associated with folding and functional transitions. However, structural information is limited, particularly with respect to different functional configurations. This is a major limitation for SBMs. Alternatively, statistical methods to study amino acid co-evolution provide information on residue–residue interactions useful for the study of structure and function. Here, we show how the combination of these two methods gives rise to a novel way to investigate the mechanisms associated with folding and function. We use this methodology to explore the mechanistic aspects of protein translocation in the integral membrane protease FtsH. Dual basin-SBM simulations using the open and closed state of this hexameric motor reveals a functionally important paddling motion in the catalytic cycle. We also find that Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) predicts physical contacts between AAA and peptidase domains of the motor, which are crucial for the open to close transition. Our combined method, which uses structural information from the open state experimental structure and co-evolutionary couplings, suggests that this methodology can be used to explore the functional landscape of complex biological macromolecules previously inaccessible to methods dependent on experimental structural information. This efficient way to sample the conformational space of large systems creates a theoretical/computational framework capable of better characterizing the functional landscape in large biomolecular assemblies.},

abstract = {We have developed a method to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein molecule from such a set of distance constraints as can be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance studies. The currently popular methods for distance geometry based on the use of the metric matrix are applicable only to small systems. The method developed here is applicable to large molecules, such as proteins, with all atoms treated explicitly. This method works in the space of variable dihedral angles and determines a three-dimensional structure by minimization of a target function. We avoid difficulties hitherto inherent in this type of approach by two new devices: (1) the use of variable target functions; and (2) a method of rapid calculation of the gradient of the target functions. The method is applied to the determination of the structures of a small globular protein, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, from several artificial sets of distance constraints extracted from the X-ray crystal structure of this molecule. When a good set of constraints was available for both short- and long-range distances, the crystal structure was regenerated nearly exactly. When some ambiguities, such as those expected in experimental information, are allowed, the protein conformation can be determined up to a few local deformations. These ambiguities are mainly associated with the low resolving power of the short-range information. © 1985.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein 3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual information, taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible.\nResults: This article presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual information, and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and, thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration.\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu.\nContact: jinboxu@gmail.com},

abstract = {Spatially proximate amino acids in a protein tend to coevolve. A protein's three-dimensional (3D) structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the evolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the context of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method, applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard mean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified score for the coupling strength. The results are verified using known crystal structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families. Code implementing the new method can be found at http://plmdca.csc.kth.se/.},

It plays a unique role in integrated structural biology approaches as especially information about conformational dynamics can be readily obtained at residue resolution. Here, we review NMR techniques for such studies focusing on state-of-the-art tools and practical aspects. An efficient approach for determining the quaternary structure of multidomain complexes starts from the structures of individual domains or subunits. The arrangement of the domains/subunits within the complex is then defined based on NMR measurements that provide information about the domain interfaces combined with (long-range) distance and orientational restraints. Aspects discussed include sample preparation, specific isotope labeling and spin labeling; determination of binding interfaces and domain/subunit arrangements from chemical shift perturbations (CSP), nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), isotope editing/filtering, cross-saturation, and differential line broadening; and based on paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) using covalent and soluble spin labels. Finally, the utility of complementary methods such as small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or fluorescence spectroscopy techniques is discussed.

We present a machine learning approach, SSELearner, to automatically identify helices and $\beta$-sheets by using the knowledge from existing volumetric maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We tested our approach using 10 simulated density maps. The averaged specificity and sensitivity for the helix detection are 94.9% and 95.8%, respectively, and those for the $\beta$-sheet detection are 86.7% and 96.4%, respectively. We have developed a secondary structure annotator, SSID, to predict the helices and $\beta$-strands from the backbone C$\alpha$ trace. With the help of SSID, we tested our SSELearner using 13 experimentally derived cryo-EM density maps. The machine learning approach shows the specificity and sensitivity of 91.8% and 74.5%, respectively, for the helix detection and 85.2% and 86.5% respectively for the $\beta$-sheet detection in cryoEM maps of Electron Microscopy Data Bank. The reduced detection accuracy reveals the challenges in SSE detection when the cryoEM maps are used instead of the simulated maps. Our results suggest that it is effective to use one cryoEM map for learning to detect the SSE in another cryoEM map of similar quality.},

abstract = {This article is a personal perspective on the developments in the field of protein folding over approximately the last 40 years. In addition to its historical aspects, the article presents a view of the principles of protein folding with particular emphasis on the relationship of these principles to the problem of protein structure prediction. It is argued that despite much that is new, the essential elements of our current understanding of protein folding were anticipated by researchers many years ago. These elements include the recognition of the central importance of the polypeptide backbone as a determinant of protein conformation, hierarchical protein folding, and multiple folding pathways. Important areas of progress include a detailed characterization of the folding pathways of a number of proteins and a fundamental understanding of the physical chemical forces that determine protein stability. Despite these developments, fold prediction algorithms still encounter difficulties in identifying the correct fold for a given sequence. This may be due to the possibility that the free energy differences between at least a few alternate conformations of many proteins are not large. Significant progress in protein structure prediction has been due primarily to the explosive growth of sequence and structural databases. However, further progress is likely to depend in part on the ability to combine information available from databases with principles and algorithms derived from physical chemical studies of protein folding. An approach to the integration of the two areas is outlined with specific reference to the PrISM program that is a fully integrated sequence/structural-analysis/fold-recognition/homology model building software system.},

abstract = {The protein structure prediction problem continues to elude scientists. Despite the introduction of many methods, only modest gains were made over the last decade for certain classes of prediction targets. To address this challenge, a social-media based worldwide collaborative effort, named WeFold, was undertaken by 13 labs. During the collaboration, the laboratories were simultaneously competing with each other. Here, we present the first attempt at "coopetition" in scientific research applied to the protein structure prediction and refinement problems. The coopetition was possible by allowing the participating labs to contribute different components of their protein structure prediction pipelines and create new hybrid pipelines that they tested during CASP10. This manuscript describes both successes and areas needing improvement as identified throughout the first WeFold experiment and discusses the efforts that are underway to advance this initiative. A footprint of all contributions and structures are publicly accessible at http://www.wefold.org.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of significant compensatory mutation signals in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is often complicated by noise. A challenging problem in bioinformatics is remains the separation of significant signals between two or more non-conserved residue sites from the phylogenetic noise and unrelated pair signals. Determination of these non-conserved residue sites is as important as the recognition of strictly cofile:///C:/Users/Raionic/Downloads/art%253A10.1186%252F1471-2105-13-225.pdfnserved positions for understanding of the structural basis of protein functions and identification of functionally important residue regions. In this study, we developed a new method, the Coupled Mutation Finder (CMF) quantifying the phylogenetic noise for the detection of compensatory mutations.\n\nRESULTS: To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we analyzed essential sites of two human proteins: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and glucokinase (GCK). Our results suggest that the CMF is able to separate significant compensatory mutation signals from the phylogenetic noise and unrelated pair signals. The vast majority of compensatory mutation sites found by the CMF are related to essential sites of both proteins and they are likely to affect protein stability or functionality.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The CMF is a new method, which includes an MSA-specific statistical model based on multiple testing procedures that quantify the error made in terms of the false discovery rate and a novel entropy-based metric to upscale BLOSUM62 dissimilar compensatory mutations. Therefore, it is a helpful tool to predict and investigate compensatory mutation sites of structural or functional importance in proteins. We suggest that the CMF could be used as a novel automated function prediction tool that is required for a better understanding of the structural basis of proteins.

abstract = {Here we present the results of residue-residue contact predictions achieved in CASP11 by the CONSIP2 server, which is based around our MetaPSICOV contact prediction method. On a set of 40 target domains with a median family size of around 40 effective sequences, our server achieved an average top-L/5 long-range contact precision of 27%. MetaPSICOV method bases on a combination of classical contact prediction features, enhanced with three distinct covariation methods embedded in a two-stage neural network predictor. Some unique features of our approach are (1) the tuning between the classical and covariation features depending on the depth of the input alignment and (2) a hybrid approach to generate deepest possible multiple-sequence alignments by combining jackHMMer and HHblits. We discuss the CONSIP2 pipeline, our results and show that where the method underperformed, the major factor was relying on a fixed set of parameters for the initial sequence alignments and not attempting to perform domain splitting as a preprocessing step.

abstract = {Divergent evolution of proteins reflects both selectively advantageous and neutral amino acid substitutions. In the present article, we examine restraints on sequence, which arise from selectively advantageous roles for structure and function and which lead to the conservation of local sequences and structures in families and superfamilies. We analyse structurally aligned members of protein families and superfamilies in order to investigate the importance of the local structural environment of amino acid residues in the acceptance of amino acid substitutions during protein evolution. We show that solvent accessibility is the most important determinant, followed by the existence of hydrogen bonds from the side-chain to main-chain functions and the nature of the element of secondary structure to which the amino acid contributes. Polar side chains whose hydrogen-bonding potential is satisfied tend to be more conserved than their unsatisfied or non-hydrogen-bonded counterparts, and buried and satisfied polar residues tend to be significantly more conserved than buried hydrophobic residues. Finally, we discuss the importance of functional restraints in the form of interactions of proteins with other macromolecules in assemblies or with substrates, ligands or allosteric regulators. We show that residues involved in such functional interactions are significantly more conserved and have differing amino acid substitution patterns.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contact maps have been extensively used as a simplified representation of protein structures. They capture most important features of a protein's fold, being preferred by a number of researchers for the description and study of protein structures. Inspired by the model's simplicity many groups have dedicated a considerable amount of effort towards contact prediction as a proxy for protein structure prediction. However a contact map's biological interest is subject to the availability of reliable methods for the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the structure. RESULTS: We use an implementation of the well-known distance geometry protocol to build realistic protein 3-dimensional models from contact maps, performing an extensive exploration of many of the parameters involved in the reconstruction process. We try to address the questions: a) to what accuracy does a contact map represent its corresponding 3D structure, b) what is the best contact map representation with regard to reconstructability and c) what is the effect of partial or inaccurate contact information on the 3D structure recovery. Our results suggest that contact maps derived from the application of a distance cutoff of 9 to 11A around the Cbeta atoms constitute the most accurate representation of the 3D structure. The reconstruction process does not provide a single solution to the problem but rather an ensemble of conformations that are within 2A RMSD of the crystal structure and with lower values for the pairwise average ensemble RMSD. Interestingly it is still possible to recover a structure with partial contact information, although wrong contacts can lead to dramatic loss in reconstruction fidelity. CONCLUSIONS: Thus contact maps represent a valid approximation to the structures with an accuracy comparable to that of experimental methods. The optimal contact definitions constitute key guidelines for methods based on contact maps such as structure prediction through contacts and structural alignments based on maximum contact map overlap.},

abstract = {We have developed a novel and robust approach for automatic and unsupervised simultaneous nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) assignment and structure determination within the CS-Rosetta framework. Starting from unassigned peak lists and chemical shift assignments, autoNOE-Rosetta determines NOE cross-peak assignments and generates structural models. The approach tolerates incomplete and raw NOE peak lists as well as incomplete or partially incorrect chemical shift assignments, and its performance has been tested on 50 protein targets ranging from 50 to 200 residues in size. We find a significantly improved performance compared to established programs, particularly for larger proteins and for NOE data obtained on perdeuterated protein samples. X-ray crystallographic structures allowed comparison of Rosetta and conventional, PDB-deposited, NMR models in 20 of 50 test cases. The unsupervised autoNOE-Rosetta models were often of significantly higher accuracy than the corresponding expert-supervised NMR models deposited in the PDB. We also tested the method with unrefined peak lists and found that performance was nearly as good as for refined peak lists. Finally, demonstrating our method's remarkable robustness against problematic input data, we provided correct models for an incorrect PDB-deposited NMR solution structure.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Helix-helix interactions play a critical role in the structure assembly, stability, and function of membrane proteins. On the molecular level, the interactions are mediated by one or more residue contacts. Although previous studies focused on helix-packing patterns and sequence motifs, few of them developed methods specifically for contact prediction. RESULTS: We present a new hierarchical framework for contact prediction, with an application in membrane proteins. The hierarchical scheme consists of two levels: in the first level, contact residues are predicted from the sequence and their pairing relationships are fur-ther predicted in the second level. Statistical analyses on contact propensities are combined with other sequence and structural infor-mation for training the support vector machine classifiers. Evaluated on 52 protein chains using leave-one-out cross validation and an independent test set of 14 protein chains, the two-level approach consistently improves the conventional direct approach in prediction accuracy, with 80% reduction of input for prediction. Furthermore, the predicted contacts are then used to infer interactions between pairs of helices. When at least three predicted contacts are required for an inferred interaction, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates are 56%, 40%, and 89%, respectively. Our results demon-strate that a hierarchical framework can be applied to eliminate false positives while reducing computational complexity in predicting con-tacts. Together with the estimated contact propensities, this method can be used to gain insights into helix-packing in membrane proteins.

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C$\alpha$ positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted $\beta$-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins.

abstract = {The structure of a protein determines its function and its interactions with other factors. Regions of proteins that interact with ligands, substrates, and/or other proteins, tend to be conserved both in sequence and structure, and the residues involved are usually in close spatial proximity. More than 70,000 protein structures are currently found in the Protein Data Bank, and approximately one-third contain metal ions essential for function. Identifying and characterizing metal ion-binding sites experimentally is time-consuming and costly. Many computational methods have been developed to identify metal ion-binding sites, and most use only sequence information. For the work reported herein, we developed a method that uses sequence and structural information to predict the residues in metal ion-binding sites. Six types of metal ion-binding templates- those involving Ca(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), and Zn(2+)-were constructed using the residues within 3.5 {\AA} of the center of the metal ion. Using the fragment transformation method, we then compared known metal ion-binding sites with the templates to assess the accuracy of our method. Our method achieved an overall 94.6 % accuracy with a true positive rate of 60.5 % at a 5 % false positive rate and therefore constitutes a significant improvement in metal-binding site prediction.},

abstract = {Position-specific substitution matrices, known as profiles, derived from multiple sequence alignments are currently used to search sequence databases for distantly related members of protein families. The performance of the database searches is enhanced by using (i) a sequence weighting scheme which assigns higher weights to more distantly related sequences based on branch lengths derived from phylogenetic trees, (ii) exclusion of positions with mainly padding characters at sites of insertions or deletions and (iii) the BLOSUM62 residue comparison matrix. A natural consequence of these modifications is an improvement in the alignment of new sequences to the profiles. However, the accuracy of the alignments can be further increased by employing a similarity residue comparison matrix. These developments are implemented in a program called PROFILEWEIGHT which runs on Unix and Vax computers. The only input required by the program is the multiple sequence alignment. The output from PROFILEWEIGHT is a profile designed to be used by existing searching and alignment programs. Test results from database searches with four different families of proteins show the improved sensitivity of the weighted profiles.},

abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore>0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

In this article, we describe a methodology for this problem that was shown to be successful in CASP8 and CASP9. The methodology is based on (i) the fusion of the prediction of a variety of structural aspects of protein residues, (ii) an ensemble strategy used to facilitate the training process and (iii) a rule-based machine learning system from which we can extract human-readable explanations of the predictor and derive useful information about the contact map representation.\n\nRESULTS: The main part of the evaluation is the comparison against the sequence-based contact prediction methods from CASP9, where our method presented the best rank in five out of the six evaluated metrics. We also assess the impact of the size of the ensemble used in our predictor to show the trade-off between performance and training time of our method. Finally, we also study the rule sets generated by our machine learning system. From this analysis, we are able to estimate the contribution of the attributes in our representation and how these interact to derive contact predictions.\n\nAVAILABILITY: http://icos.cs.nott.ac.uk/servers/psp.html.\n\nCONTACT: natalio.krasnogor@nottingham.ac.uk\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

PPases require several (three or four) Mg2+ ions at the active site for activity and many of the 15-17 fully conserved active site residues are directly involved in the binding of metal ions. Each of the eight microscopic rate constants that has been evaluated for the PPases from both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is quite similar in magnitude for the two enzymes, supporting the notion of a conserved mechanism. ?? 1992.},

Qprob calculates the absolute error for each protein feature value against the true quality scores (i.e. GDT-TS scores) of protein structural models, and uses them to estimate its probability density distribution for quality assessment. Qprob has been blindly tested on the 11th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11) as MULTICOM-NOVEL server. The official CASP result shows that Qprob ranks as one of the top single-model QA methods. In addition, Qprob makes contributions to our protein tertiary structure predictor MULTICOM, which is officially ranked 3rd out of 143 predictors. The good performance shows that Qprob is good at assessing the quality of models of hard targets.

abstract = {Three-dimensional structures of proteins are the support of their biological functions. Their folds are stabilized by contacts between residues. Inner protein contacts are generally described through direct atomic contacts, i.e. interactions between side-chain atoms, while contact prediction methods mainly used inter-C$\alpha$ distances. In this paper, we have analyzed the protein contacts on a recent high quality non-redundant databank using different criteria. First, we have studied the average number of contacts depending on the distance threshold to define a contact. Preferential contacts between types of amino acids have been highlighted. Detailed analyses have been done concerning the proximity of contacts in the sequence, the size of the proteins and fold classes. The strongest differences have been extracted, highlighting important residues. Then, we studied the influence of five different side-chain conformation prediction methods (SCWRL, IRECS, SCAP, SCATD and SCCOMP) on the distribution of contacts. The prediction rates of these different methods are quite similar. However, using a distance criterion between side chains, the results are quite different, e.g. SCAP predicts 50% more contacts than observed, unlike other methods that predict fewer contacts than observed. Contacts deduced are quite distinct from one method to another with at most 75% contacts in common. Moreover, distributions of amino acid preferential contacts present unexpected behaviours distinct from previously observed in the X-ray structures, especially at the surface of proteins. For instance, the interactions involving Tryptophan greatly decrease. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

One or three distance steps are used to describe the range of interactions between a pair. Training is carried out with the mathematical programming approach on the decoy sets of Baker, Levitt, and some of our own design. Recognition is required not only for decoy-native structural pairs but also for pairs of decoy and homologous structures. Performance is tested on the targets of CASP5 using templates from the Protein Data Bank, on two test ab initio decoy sets from Skolnick's laboratory, and on decoy sets from Moult's laboratory. We conclude that the newly derived potentials have significant recognition capacity, comparable to the best models derived from other techniques. The new potentials require a significantly smaller number of parameters. The enhanced recognition capacity extends primarily to the identification of structures generated by ab initio simulation and less to the recognition of approximate shapes created by homology.},

@article{Ding2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Despite continuing progress in X-ray crystallography and high-field NMR spectroscopy for determination of three-dimensional protein structures, the number of unsolved and newly discovered sequences grows much faster than that of determined structures. Protein modeling methods can possibly bridge this huge sequence-structure gap with the development of computational science. A grand challenging problem is to predict three-dimensional protein structure from its primary structure (residues sequence) alone. However, predicting residue contact maps is a crucial and promising intermediate step towards final three-dimensional structure prediction. Better predictions of local and non-local contacts between residues can transform protein sequence alignment to structure alignment, which can finally improve template based three-dimensional protein structure predictors greatly. METHODS: CNNcon, an improved multiple neural networks based contact map predictor using six sub-networks and one final cascade-network, was developed in this paper. Both the sub-networks and the final cascade-network were trained and tested with their corresponding data sets. While for testing, the target protein was first coded and then input to its corresponding sub-networks for prediction. After that, the intermediate results were input to the cascade-network to finish the final prediction. RESULTS: The CNNcon can accurately predict 58.86% in average of contacts at a distance cutoff of 8 {\AA} for proteins with lengths ranging from 51 to 450. The comparison results show that the present method performs better than the compared state-of-the-art predictors. Particularly, the prediction accuracy keeps steady with the increase of protein sequence length. It indicates that the CNNcon overcomes the thin density problem, with which other current predictors have trouble. This advantage makes the method valuable to the prediction of long length proteins. As a result, the effective prediction of long length proteins could be possible by the CNNcon.},

abstract = {In biological NMR, assignment of NOE cross-peaks and calculation of atomic conformations are critical steps in the determination of reliable high-resolution structures. ARIA is an automated approach that performs NOE assignment and structure calculation in a concomitant manner in an iterative procedure. The log-harmonic shape for distance restraint potential and the Bayesian weighting of distance restraints, recently introduced in ARIA, were shown to significantly improve the quality and the accuracy of determined structures. In this paper, we propose two modifications of the ARIA protocol: (1) the softening of the force field together with adapted hydrogen radii, which is meaningful in the context of the log-harmonic potential with Bayesian weighting, (2) a procedure that automatically adjusts the violation tolerance used in the selection of active restraints, based on the fitting of the structure to the input data sets. The new ARIA protocols were fine-tuned on a set of eight protein targets from the CASD-NMR initiative. As a result, the convergence problems previously observed for some targets was resolved and the obtained structures exhibited better quality. In addition, the new ARIA protocols were applied for the structure calculation of ten new CASD-NMR targets in a blind fashion, i.e. without knowing the actual solution. Even though optimisation of parameters and pre-filtering of unrefined NOE peak lists were necessary for half of the targets, ARIA consistently and reliably determined very precise and highly accurate structures for all cases. In the context of integrative structural biology, an increasing number of experimental methods are used that produce distance data for the determination of 3D structures of macromolecules, stressing the importance of methods that successfully make use of ambiguous and noisy distance data.},

abstract = {Understanding protein structure is of crucial importance in science, medicine and biotechnology. For about two decades, knowledge-based potentials based on pairwise distances – so-called “potentials of mean force” (PMFs) – have been center stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the simulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations of these potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal choice of the reference state – a necessary component of these potentials – is an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible work theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on a likelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many questions unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as approximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic justification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over different features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities “reference ratio distributions” deriving from the application of the “reference ratio method.” This new view is not only of theoretical relevance but leads to many insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely defined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be generalized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein structure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities is justified. We illustrate these insights with two applications, involving the radius of gyration and hydrogen bonding. In the latter case, we also show how the reference ratio method can be iteratively applied to sculpt an energy funnel. Our results considerably increase the understanding and scope of energy functions derived from known biomolecular structures.},

abstract = {Members of the G protein superfamily contain nucleotide-dependent switches that dictate the specificity of their interactions with binding partners. Using a sequence-based method termed statistical coupling analysis (SCA), we have attempted to identify the allosteric core of these proteins, the network of amino acid residues that couples the domains responsible for nucleotide binding and protein-protein interactions. One-third of the 38 residues identified by SCA were mutated in the G protein Gs alpha, and the interactions of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate- and GDP-bound mutant proteins were tested with both adenylyl cyclase (preferential binding to GTP-Gs alpha) and the G protein beta gamma subunit complex (preferential binding to GDP-Gs alpha). A two-state allosteric model predicts that mutation of residues that control the equilibrium between GDP- and GTP-bound conformations of the protein will cause the ratio of affinities of these species for adenylyl cyclase and G beta gamma to vary in a reciprocal fashion. Observed results were consistent with this prediction. The network of residues identified by the SCA appears to comprise a core allosteric mechanism conferring nucleotide-dependent switching; the specific features of different G protein family members are built on this core.},

abstract = {Various approaches have explored the covariation of residues in multiple-sequence alignments of homologous proteins to extract functional and structural information. Among those are principal component analysis (PCA), which identifies the most correlated groups of residues, and direct coupling analysis (DCA), a global inference method based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims at predicting residue-residue contacts. In this paper, inspired by the statistical physics of disordered systems, we introduce the Hopfield-Potts model to naturally interpolate between these two approaches. The Hopfield-Potts model allows us to identify relevant 'patterns' of residues from the knowledge of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the residue-residue correlation matrix. We show how the computation of such statistical patterns makes it possible to accurately predict residue-residue contacts with a much smaller number of parameters than DCA. This dimensional reduction allows us to avoid overfitting and to extract contact information from multiple-sequence alignments of reduced size. In addition, we show that low-eigenvalue correlation modes, discarded by PCA, are important to recover structural information: the corresponding patterns are highly localized, that is, they are concentrated in few sites, which we find to be in close contact in the three-dimensional protein fold.},

When these quantitative measures are integrated with crystal structure data and summarized using helical wheels, they provide important insights into the evolution of three-dimensional structure in these proteins. We show that amino acid sites in the bHLH domain known to pack against each other have very low entropy values, indicating little residue diversity at these contact sites. Noncontact sites, on the other hand, exhibit significantly larger entropy values, as well as statistically significant levels of mutual information or association among sites. High levels of mutual information indicate significant amounts of intercorrelation among amino acid residues at these various sites. Using computer simulations based on a parametric bootstrap procedure, we are able to partition the observed covariation among various amino acid sites into that arising from phylogenetic (common ancestry) and stochastic causes and those resulting from structural and functional constraints. These results show that a significant amount of the observed covariation among amino acid sites is due to structural/functional constraints, over and above the covariation arising from phylogenetic constraints. These quantitative analyses provide a highly integrated evolutionary picture of the multidimensional dynamics of sequence diversity and protein structure.},

abstract = {The major feature of many proteins is a large $\beta$-sheet that twists and coils to form a closed structure in which the first strand is hydrogen bonded to the last: the $\beta$-sheet barrel. McLachlan classified barrels in terms of two integral parameters: the number of strands in the $\beta$-sheet, n, and the "shear number", S, a measure of the stagger of the strands in the $\beta$-sheet. He showed that the mean radius of a barrel and the extent to which strands are tilted relative to its axis are determined by the values of n and S. Here we show that the (n, S) values determine all the other general structural features of regular $\beta$-sheet barrels, in particular, optimal values of the twist and coiling angles that produce the closed $\beta$-sheet, the hyperboloidal shape and the arrangement of residues in the barrel interior. Consideration of the residue arrangements in the interiors of different potential barrel structures, and of side-chain volumes, suggest that barrels, in which the interiors are close packed by the residues in $\beta$-sheets with good geometries, have structures that correspond to one of only ten different combinations of n and S. In the accompanying paper, we demonstrate, by an analysis of all observed protein structures that contain $\beta$-sheet barrels and for which atomic co-ordinates are available, the validity of these theoretical results. © 1994.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions play important roles in the control of every cellular process. How natural selection has optimized protein design to produce molecules capable of binding to many partner proteins is a fascinating problem but not well understood. Here, we performed a combinatorial analysis of protein sequence evolution and conformational dynamics to study how calmodulin (CaM), which plays essential roles in calcium signaling pathways, has adapted to bind to a large number of partner proteins. We discovered that amino acid residues in CaM can be partitioned into unique classes according to their degree of evolutionary conservation and local stability. Holistically, categorization of CaM residues into these classes reveals enriched physico-chemical interactions required for binding to diverse targets, balanced against the need to maintain the folding and structural modularity of CaM to achieve its overall function. The sequence-structure-function relationship of CaM provides a concrete example of the general principle of protein design. We have demonstrated the synergy between the fields of molecular evolution and protein biophysics and created a generalizable framework broadly applicable to the study of protein-protein interactions.},

Direct-Coupling Analysis (DCA), a global statistical inference method, successfully models this variability across homologous protein families to infer structural information about proteins. For each residue pair, DCA infers 21 × 21 matrices describing the coevolutionary coupling for each pair of amino acids (or gaps). To achieve the residue-residue contact prediction, these matrices are mapped onto simple scalar parameters; the full information they contain gets lost. Here, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the coupling matrices resulting from 70 protein families, to show that they contain quantitative information about the physico-chemical properties of amino-acid interactions. Results for protein families are corroborated by the analysis of synthetic data from lattice-protein models, which emphasizes the critical effect of sampling quality and regularization on the biochemical features of the statistical coupling matrices.},

This information can be efficiently mined to detect evolutionary couplings between residues in proteins and address the long-standing challenge to compute protein three-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Elucidating the cooperative mechanism of interconnected residues is an important component toward understanding the biological function of a protein. Coevolution analysis has been developed to model the coevolutionary information reflecting structural and functional constraints. Recently, several methods have been developed based on a probabilistic graphical model called the Markov random field (MRF), which have led to significant improvements for coevolution analysis; however, thus far, the performance of these models has mainly been assessed by focusing on the aspect of protein structure. In this study, we built an MRF model whose graphical topology is determined by the residue proximity in the protein structure, and derived a novel positional coevolution estimate utilizing the node weight of the MRF model. This structure-based MRF method was evaluated for three data sets, each of which annotates catalytic site, allosteric site, and comprehensively determined functional site information. We demonstrate that the structure-based MRF architecture can encode the evolutionary information associated with biological function. Furthermore, we show that the node weight can more accurately represent positional coevolution information compared to the edge weight. Lastly, we demonstrate that the structure-based MRF model can be reliably built with only a few aligned sequences in linear time. The results show that adoption of a structure-based architecture could be an acceptable approximation for coevolution modeling with efficient computation complexity.},

abstract = {Here, we present a diverse, structurally nonredundant data set of two-chain protein-protein interfaces derived from the PDB. Using a sequence order-independent structural comparison algorithm and hierarchical clustering, 3799 interface clusters are obtained. These yield 103 clusters with at least five nonhomologous members. We divide the clusters into three types. In Type I clusters, the global structures of the chains from which the interfaces are derived are also similar. This cluster type is expected because, in general, related proteins associate in similar ways. In Type II, the interfaces are similar; however, remarkably, the overall structures and functions of the chains are different. The functional spectrum is broad, from enzymes/inhibitors to immunoglobulins and toxins. The fact that structurally different monomers associate in similar ways, suggests "good" binding architectures. This observation extends a paradigm in protein science: It has been well known that proteins with similar structures may have different functions. Here, we show that it extends to interfaces. In Type III clusters, only one side of the interface is similar across the cluster. This structurally nonredundant data set provides rich data for studies of protein-protein interactions and recognition, cellular networks and drug design. In particular, it may be useful in addressing the difficult question of what are the favorable ways for proteins to interact.

abstract = {Much progress has been made in Protein structure prediction during the last few decades. As the predicted models can span a broad range of accuracy spectrum, the accuracy of quality estimation becomes one of the key elements of successful protein structure prediction. Over the past years, a number of methods have been developed to address this issue, and these methods could be roughly divided into three categories: the single-model methods, clustering-based methods and quasi single-model methods. In this study, we develop a single-model method MQAPRank based on the learning-to-rank algorithm firstly, and then implement a quasi single-model method Quasi-MQAPRank. The proposed methods are benchmarked on the 3DRobot and CASP11 dataset. The five-fold cross-validation on the 3DRobot dataset shows the proposed single model method outperforms other methods whose outputs are taken as features of the proposed method, and the quasi single-model method can further enhance the performance. On the CASP11 dataset, the proposed methods also perform well compared with other leading methods in corresponding categories. In particular, the Quasi-MQAPRank method achieves a considerable performance on the CASP11 Best150 dataset.},

The balance between the level of detail in describing the specific interactions within proteins and the accuracy obtained using minimal protein models is the focus of many current protein studies. Recent results suggest that the introduction of explicit orientation dependence in a coarse-grained, residue-level model improves the ability of inter-residue potentials to recognize the native state.

The improvements include (1) a decomposition of the complete embedding process into two successive, more tractable calculations by the use of “substructures”, (2) a compact data structure for storing incomplete distance information on a structure, (3) a more efficient shortest-path algorithm for computing the triangle inequality limits on all distances from this information, (4) a new algorithm for selecting random metric spaces from within these limits, (5) the use of chirality constraints to obtain good covalent geometry without the use ofad hoc weights or excessive optimization. The utility of the resultant program with nuclear magnetic resonance data is demonstrated by embedding complete spatial structures for the protein basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor vs all 508 intramolecular, interresidue proton-proton contacts shorter than 4.0 that were present in its crystal structure. The crystal structure could be reproduced from this data set to within 1.3 minimum root mean square coordinate difference between the backbone atoms.

abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning?

abstract = {Binding interactions between proteins and other molecules mediate numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, signaling, and regulation of gene expression. These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or when genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we investigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise to evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding strength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these protein traits can emerge as evolutionary "spandrels" even if they do not confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to stabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending on random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in high-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is developed. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of fundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of a protein is organized around the packing of its secondary structure elements. Although much is known about the packing geometry observed between alpha-helices and between beta-sheets, there has been little progress on characterizing helix-sheet interactions. We present an analysis of the conformation of alphabeta(2) motifs in proteins, corresponding to all occurrences of helices in contact with two strands that are hydrogen bonded. The geometry of the alphabeta(2) motif is characterized by the azimuthal angle theta between the helix axis and an average vector representing the two strands, the elevation angle psi between the helix axis and the plane containing the two strands, and the distance D between the helix and the strands. We observe that the helix tends to align to the two strands, with a preference for an antiparallel orientation if the two strands are parallel; this preference is diminished for other topologies of the beta-sheet. Side-chain packing at the interface between the helix and the strands is mostly hydrophobic, with a preference for aliphatic amino acids in the strand and aromatic amino acids in the helix. From the knowledge of the geometry and amino acid propensities of alphabeta(2) motifs in proteins, we have derived different statistical potentials that are shown to be efficient in picking native-like conformations among a set of non-native conformations in well-known decoy datasets. The information on the geometry of alphabeta(2) motifs as well as the related statistical potentials have applications in the field of protein structure prediction.},

abstract = {The number of known three-dimensional protein sequences is orders of magnitude higher than the number of known protein structures. This is a result of an increase in large-scale genomic sequencing projects, the inability of proteins to crystallize or crystals to diffract well, or a simple lack of resources. An alternative is to use one of a variety of available homology modeling programs to produce a computational model of a protein. Protein models are produced using information from known protein structures found to be similar. Here, we compare the ability of a number of popular homology modeling programs to produce quality models from user-defined target-template sequence alignments over a range of circumstances including low sequence identity, variable sequence length, and when interfaced with a protein or small molecule. Programs evaluated include Prime, SWISS-MODEL, MOE, MODELLER, ROSETTA, Composer, ORCHESTRAR, and I-TASSER. Proteins to be modeled were chosen to test a range of sequence identities, sequence lengths, and protein motifs and all are of scientific importance. These include HIV-1 protease, kinases, dihydrofolate reductase, a viral capsid protein, and factor Xa among others. For the most part, the programs produce results that are similar. For example, all programs are able to produce reasonable models when sequence identities are >30% and all programs have difficulties producing complete models when sequence identities are lower. However, certain programs fare slightly better than others in certain situations and we attempt to provide insight on this topic.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment (ARIA) is a software protocol that integrates automated nuclear Overhanser effect (NOE) assignments into structure calculations. This chapter outlines the different tasks performed by the program ARIA, describes the theory behind the automatic assignment protocols, including some recent developments, and discusses practical experiences with using ARIA. The most important advantage is the substantial speedup of structure calculation that can be achieved by automation of one of the most time-consuming steps. Compared with a manual approach where initial structures are calculated based on a small fraction of the NOEs, the automated approach uses many more data to direct the calculation from the start. The restraints that need to be rejected during the calculation can be viewed as an integral part of the result, can be analyzed in a systematic way, and might even be submitted with the structures and the active restraints. In addition to the more complete description of the result, all parameters used in assigning and selecting restraints are documented, and hence the entire calculation can be reproduced. For manual methods, experience has already shown that such a level of documentation is usually not feasible.},

However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for $\beta$-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs. The improved contact prediction enables improved structure prediction.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Biological network alignment aims to identify similar regions between networks of different species. Existing methods compute node similarities to rapidly identify from possible alignments the high-scoring alignments with respect to the overall node similarity. But, the accuracy of the alignments is then evaluated with some other measure that is different than the node similarity used to construct the alignments. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges. Thus, the existing methods align similar nodes between networks hoping to conserve many edges (after the alignment is constructed!). RESULTS Instead, we introduce MAGNA to directly 'optimize' edge conservation while the alignment is constructed, without decreasing the quality of node mapping. MAGNA uses a genetic algorithm and our novel function for 'crossover' of two 'parent' alignments into a superior 'child' alignment to simulate a 'population' of alignments that 'evolves' over time; the 'fittest' alignments survive and proceed to the next 'generation', until the alignment accuracy cannot be optimized further. While we optimize our new and superior measure of the amount of conserved edges, MAGNA can optimize any alignment accuracy measure, including a combined measure of both node and edge conservation. In systematic evaluations against state-of-the-art methods (IsoRank, MI-GRAAL and GHOST), on both synthetic networks and real-world biological data, MAGNA outperforms all of the existing methods, in terms of both node and edge conservation as well as both topological and biological alignment accuracy.

abstract = {Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.},

abstract = {Inter-residue proximity constraints obtained in such experiments as cross-linking/mass spectrometry are important sources of information for protein structure determination. A central question in structure determination using these constraints is, What is the minimal number of inter-residue constraints needed to determine the fold of a protein? It is also unknown how the different structural aspects of constraints differentiate their ability in determining the native fold and whether there is a rational strategy for selecting constraints that feature higher fidelity in structure determination. To shed light on these questions, we study the fidelity of protein fold determination using theoretical inter-residue proximity constraints derived from protein native structures and the effect of various subsets of such constraints on fold determination. We show that approximately 70% randomly selected constraints are sufficient for determining the fold of a domain (with an average root-mean-square deviation of <or=3.4 A from their native structures). We find that random constraint selection often outperforms the rational strategy that predominantly favors the constraints representing global structural features. To uncover a strategy for constraint selection for the optimal structure determination, we study the role of the topological properties of these constraints. Interestingly, we do not observe any correlation between various simple topological properties of the selected constraints, emphasizing different global and local structural features, and the performance of these constraints, suggesting that accurate protein structure determination relies on a composite of global and local structural information.},

abstract = {Conventional NMR structure determination requires nearly complete assignment of the cross peaks of a refined NOESY peak list. Depending on the size of the protein and quality of the spectral data, this can be a time-consuming manual process requiring several rounds of peak list refinement and structure determination. Programs such as Aria, CYANA, and AutoStructure can generate models using unassigned NOESY data but are very sensitive to the quality of the input peak lists and can converge to inaccurate structures if the signal-to-noise of the peak lists is low. Here, we show that models with high accuracy and reliability can be produced by combining the strengths of the high-resolution structure prediction program Rosetta with global measures of the agreement between structure models and experimental data. A first round of models generated using CS-Rosetta (Rosetta supplemented with backbone chemical shift information) are filtered on the basis of their goodness-of-fit with unassigned NOESY peak lists using the DP-score, and the best fitting models are subjected to high resolution refinement with the Rosetta rebuild-and-refine protocol. This hybrid approach uses both local backbone chemical shift and the unassigned NOESY data to direct Rosetta trajectories toward the native structure and produces more accurate models than AutoStructure/CYANA or CS-Rosetta alone, particularly when using raw unedited NOESY peak lists. We also show that when accurate manually refined NOESY peak lists are available, Rosetta refinement can consistently increase the accuracy of models generated using CYANA and AutoStructure.},

The coherence between the different structural clusters and the basins of the FEL, together with the convergence of parameters derived by PCA indicates that an accurate description of the Mb conformational space around the native state was achieved by multiple MD trajectories spanning at least 0.14 $\mu$s. The integration of FEL, PCA, and structural clustering was shown to be a very useful approach to gain an overall view of the conformational landscape accessible to a protein and to identify representative protein substates. This method could be also used to investigate the conformational and dynamical properties of Mb apo-, mutant, or delete versions, in which greater conformational variability is expected and, therefore identification of representative substates from the simulations is relevant to disclose structure–function relationship.},

The von Neumann entropy is another extension of the Shannon entropy, adapted from quantum mechanics in order to account for amino acid similarities. However, there is yet no relative von Neumann entropy defined for sequence analysis. We introduce a new definition of the von Neumann entropy for use in sequence analysis, which we found to perform better than the previous definition. We also introduce the relative von Neumann entropy and a way of parametrizing this in order to obtain the Shannon entropy, the relative Shannon entropy and the von Neumann entropy at special parameter values.

We illustrate the method for NMR structure calculations of three proteins: interleukin-4, ubiquitin, and crambin. We show a comparison of their structure ensembles before and after refinement in water with and without a force field energy term for the dihedral angles; crambin was also refined in DMSO. Our results demonstrate the significant improvement of structure quality by a short refinement in a thin layer of solvent. Further, they show that a dihedral angle energy term in the force field is beneficial for structure calculation and refinement. We discuss the optimal weight for the energy constant for the backbone angle omega and include an extensive discussion of meaning and relevance of the calculated validation criteria, in particular root mean square Z scores for covalent parameters such as bond lengths.},

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein contact prediction is important for protein structure and functional study. Both evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis and supervised machine learning methods have been developed, making use of different information sources. However, contact prediction is still challenging especially for proteins without a large number of sequence homologs. RESULTS: This article presents a group graphical lasso (GGL) method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family EC analysis and supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence homologs. Different from existing single-family EC analysis that uses residue coevolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC analysis uses residue coevolution in both the target family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. To implement this, we model a set of related protein families using Gaussian graphical models and then coestimate their parameters by maximum-likelihood, subject to the constraint that these parameters shall be similar to some degree. Our GGL method can also integrate supervised learning methods to further improve accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods on proteins without thousands of sequence homologs, and that our method performs better on both conserved and family-specific contacts.

@article{Herrmann2002,
abstract = {Combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination module (CANDID) is a new software for efficient NMR structure determination of proteins by automated assignment of the NOESY spectra. CANDID uses an iterative approach with multiple cycles of NOE cross-peak assignment and protein structure calculation using the fast DYANA torsion angle dynamics algorithm, so that the result from each CANDID cycle consists of exhaustive, possibly ambiguous NOE cross-peak assignments in all available spectra and a three-dimensional protein structure represented by a bundle of conformers. The input for the first CANDID cycle consists of the amino acid sequence, the chemical shift list from the sequence-specific resonance assignment, and listings of the cross-peak positions and volumes in one or several two, three or four-dimensional NOESY spectra. The input for the second and subsequent CANDID cycles contains the three-dimensional protein structure from the previous cycle, in addition to the complete input used for the first cycle. CANDID includes two new elements that make it robust with respect to the presence of artifacts in the input data, i.e. network-anchoring and constraint-combination, which have a key role in de novo protein structure determinations for the successful generation of the correct polypeptide fold by the first CANDID cycle. Network-anchoring makes use of the fact that any network of correct NOE cross-peak assignments forms a self-consistent set; the initial, chemical shift-based assignments for each individual NOE cross-peak are therefore weighted by the extent to which they can be embedded into the network formed by all other NOE cross-peak assignments. Constraint-combination reduces the deleterious impact of artifact NOE upper distance constraints in the input for a protein structure calculation by combining the assignments for two or several peaks into a single upper limit distance constraint, which lowers the probability that the presence of an artifact peak will influence the outcome of the structure calculation. CANDID test calculations were performed with NMR data sets of four proteins for which high-quality structures had previously been solved by interactive protocols, and they yielded comparable results to these reference structure determinations with regard to both the residual constraint violations, and the precision and accuracy of the atomic coordinates. The CANDID approach has further been validated by de novo NMR structure determinations of four additional proteins. The experience gained in these calculations shows that once nearly complete sequence-specific resonance assignments are available, the automated CANDID approach results in greatly enhanced efficiency of the NOESY spectral analysis. The fact that the correct fold is obtained in cycle 1 of a de novo structure calculation is the single most important advance achieved with CANDID, when compared with previously proposed automated NOESY assignment methods that do not use network-anchoring and constraint-combination. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {One of the most important challenges in modern protein NMR is the development of fast and sensitive structure quality assessment measures that can be used to evaluate the "goodness-of-fit" of the 3D structure with NOESY data, to indicate the correctness of the fold and accuracy of the resulting structure. Quality assessment is especially critical for automated NOESY interpretation and structure determination approaches. This paper describes new NMR quality assessment scores, including Recall, Precision, and F-measure scores (referred to here are "NMR RPF" scores), which quickly provide global measures of the goodness-of-fit of the 3D structures with NOESY peak lists using methods from information retrieval statistics. The sensitivity of the F-measure is improved using a scaled Fold Discriminating Power (DP) score. These statistical RPF scores are quite rapid to compute since NOE assignments and complete relaxation matrix calculations are not required. A graphical method for site-specific assessment of structure quality based on the Precision statistic is also described. These statistical measures are demonstrated to be valuable for assessing protein NMR structure accuracy. Their relationships to other proposed NMR "R-factors" and structure quality assessment scores are also discussed.},

Secondary structural restraints are provided by the PHD secondary structure prediction algorithm that incorporates multiple sequence information. Multiple sequence alignments also provide predicted tertiary restraints via a two-step process: First, seed side chain contacts are selected from a correlated mutation analysis, and then an inverse folding algorithm expands these seed contacts. The predicted secondary and tertiary restraints are incorporated into a lattice-based, reduced protein model for structure assembly and refinement. The resulting native-like topologies exhibit a coordinate root-mean-square deviation from native for the whole chain between 3.1 and 6.7 A, with values ranging from 2.6 to 4.1 A over approximately 80% of the structure. Overall, this study suggests that the use of restraints derived from multiple sequence alignments combined with a fold assembly algorithm is a promising approach to the prediction of the global topology of small proteins.},

abstract = {This chapter gives an overview of automated protein structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with the UNIO protocol that enables high to full automation of all NMR data analysis steps involved. Four established algorithms, namely, the MATCH algorithm for sequence-specific resonance assignment, the ASCAN algorithm for side-chain resonance assignment, the CANDID algorithm for NOE assignment, and the ATNOS algorithm for signal identification in NMR spectra, are assembled into three principal UNIO NMR data analysis components (MATCH, ATNOS/ASCAN, and ATNOS/CANDID) that are accessed thanks to a particularly intuitive and flexible, yet powerful graphical user interface (GUI). UNIO is designed to work independently or in association with other NMR software. The principal data analysis components for sequence-specific backbone, side-chain and NOE assignment may be run separately or out of sequence. User-intervention at individual stages is encouraged and facilitated by graphical tools included for the preparation, analysis, validation, and subsequent presentation of the NMR structure.},

The algorithm determines the limits of the conformation space occupied by the polypeptide chain. The experimental data are used in such a way that the real conformation should in all cases be within these limits. Two important features of the method are that the results do not depend critically on the accuracy of the distance measurements by nuclear Overhauser enhancement studies and that internal mobility of the polypeptide conformation is explicitly taken into consideration.

For three leucine zipper sequences, we have calculated ensembles of structures spanning all possible backbone conformations consistent with the canonical coiled-coil geometry. MFPs were measured with the program prosa. The MFP alone was poor at discriminating the native structure from very divergent structures, and the global minimum of the MFP sometimes occurred far from the native structure. We found that adding an internal energy function (a subset of the charmm potential that describes only interactions between backbone atoms), the resultant total energy (charmm+prosa) performed much better; in each case, there was a clear positive correlation between total energy and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the experimental structure, and the lowest-energy structures were about 1 {\AA} RMSD from the experimental structures. Thus, we conclude that the combined potential is a powerful method for predicting leucine zippers and is very promising for general 3D structure prediction.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent developments of statistical techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings between residue pairs have rendered covariation-based contact prediction a viable means for accurate 3D modelling of proteins, with no information other than the sequence required. To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues.\n\nRESULTS: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts-around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MetaPSICOV is available as a freely available web server at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/MetaPSICOV. Raw data (predicted contact lists and 3D models) and source code can be downloaded from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/MetaPSICOV.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Protein interfaces are thought to be distinguishable from the rest of the protein surface by their greater degree of residue conservation. We test the validity of this approach on an expanded set of 64 protein-protein interfaces using conservation scores derived from two multiple sequence alignment types, one of close homologs/orthologs and one of diverse homologs/paralogs. Overall, we find that the interface is slightly more conserved than the rest of the protein surface when using either alignment type, with alignments of diverse homologs showing marginally better discrimination. However, using a novel surface-patch definition, we find that the interface is rarely significantly more conserved than other surface patches when using either alignment type. When an interface is among the most conserved surface patches, it tends to be part of an enzyme active site. The most conserved surface patch overlaps with 39% (+/- 28%) and 36% (+/- 28%) of the actual interface for diverse and close homologs, respectively. Contrary to results obtained from smaller data sets, this work indicates that residue conservation is rarely sufficient for complete and accurate prediction of protein interfaces. Finally, we find that obligate interfaces differ from transient interfaces in that the former have significantly fewer alignment gaps at the interface than the rest of the protein surface, as well as having buried interface residues that are more conserved than partially buried interface residues.},

abstract = {We compare results of the community efforts in modeling protein structures in the tenth CASP experiment, with those in earlier CASPs particularly in CASP5, a decade ago. There is a substantial improvement in template based model accuracy as reflected in more successful modeling of regions of structure not easily derived from a single experimental structure template, most likely reflecting intensive work within the modeling community in developing methods that make use of multiple templates, as well as the increased number of experimental structures available. Deriving structural information not obvious from a template is the most demanding as well as one of the most useful tasks that modeling can perform. Thus this is gratifying progress. By contrast, overall backbone accuracy of models appears little changed in the last decade. This puzzling result is explained by two factors--increased database size in some ways makes it harder to choose the best available templates, and the increased intrinsic difficulty of CASP targets as experimental work has progressed to larger and more unusual structures. There is no detectable recent improvement in template-free modeling, but again, this may reflect the changing nature of CASP targets.},

@article{Gultas2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of functionally or structurally important non-conserved residue sites in protein MSAs is an important challenge for understanding the structural basis and molecular mechanism of protein functions. Despite the rich literature on compensatory mutations as well as sequence conservation analysis for the detection of those important residues, previous methods often rely on classical information-theoretic measures. However, these measures usually do not take into account dis/similarities of amino acids which are likely to be crucial for those residues. In this study, we present a new method, the Quantum Coupled Mutation Finder (QCMF) that incorporates significant dis/similar amino acid pair signals in the prediction of functionally or structurally important sites.\n\nRESULTS: The result of this study is twofold. First, using the essential sites of two human proteins, namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and glucokinase (GCK), we tested the QCMF-method. QCMF includes two metrics based on quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure both sequence conservation and compensatory mutations. We found that QCMF reaches an improved performance in identifying essential sites from MSAs of both proteins with a significantly higher Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value in comparison to previous methods. Second, using a data set of 153 proteins, we made a pairwise comparison between QCMF and three conventional methods. This comparison study strongly suggests that QCMF complements the conventional methods for the identification of correlated mutations in MSAs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: QCMF utilizes the notion of entanglement, which is a major resource of quantum information, to model significant dissimilar and similar amino acid pair signals in the detection of functionally or structurally important sites. Our results suggest that on the one hand QCMF significantly outperforms the previous method, which mainly focuses on dissimilar amino acid signals, to detect essential sites in proteins. On the other hand, it is complementary to the existing methods for the identification of correlated mutations. The method of QCMF is computationally intensive. To ensure a feasible computation time of the QCMF's algorithm, we leveraged Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The QCMF server is freely accessible at http://qcmf.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/.},

abstract = {Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a method for analyzing multiple sequence alignments that was used to identify groups of coevolving residues termed "sectors". The method applies spectral analysis to a matrix obtained by combining correlation information with sequence conservation. It has been asserted that the protein sectors identified by SCA are functionally significant, with different sectors controlling different biochemical properties of the protein. Here we reconsider the available experimental data and note that it involves almost exclusively proteins with a single sector. We show that in this case sequence conservation is the dominating factor in SCA, and can alone be used to make statistically equivalent functional predictions. Therefore, we suggest shifting the experimental focus to proteins for which SCA identifies several sectors. Correlations in protein alignments, which have been shown to be informative in a number of independent studies, would then be less dominated by sequence conservation.},

abstract = {The problem of protein structure prediction is formulated here as that of evaluating how well an amino acid sequence fits a hypothetical structure. The simplest and most complicated approaches, secondary structure prediction and all-atom free energy calculations, can be viewed as sequence-structure fitness problems. Here, an approach of intermediate complexity is described, which involves; (1) description of a protein structure in terms of contact interface vectors, with both intra-protein and protein-solvent contacts counted, (2) derivation of sequence preferences for 2 up to 29 contact interface types, (3) generation of numerous hypothetical model structures by placing the input sequence into a large set of known three-dimensional structures in all possible alignments, (4) evaluation of these models by summing the sequence preferences over all structural positions and (5) choice of predicted three-dimensional structure as that with the best sequence-structure fitness. Evolutionary information is incorporated by using position-dependent core weights derived from multiple sequence alignments. A number of tests of the method are performed: (1) evaluation of cyclic shifts of a sequence in its native structure; (2) alignment of a sequence in its native structure, allowing gaps; (3) alignment search with a sequence or sequence fragment in a database of structures; and (4) alignment search with a structure in a database of sequences. The main results are: (1) a native sequence can very well find its native structure among a large number of alternatives, in correct alignment; (2) substructures, such as (beta alpha)n units, can be detected in spite of very low sequence similarity; (3) remote homologous can be detected, with some dependence on the set of parameters used; (4) contact interface parameters are clearly superior to classical secondary structure parameters; (5) a simple interface description in terms of just two states, protein-protein and protein-water contacts, performs surprisingly well; (6) the use of core weights considerably improves accuracy in detection of remote homologues; (7) based on a sequence database search with a myoglobin contact profile, the C-terminal domain of a viral origin of replication binding protein is predicted to have an all-helical fold. The sequence-structure fitness concept is sufficiently general to accommodate a large variety of protein structure prediction methods, including new models of intermediate complexity currently being developed.},

abstract = {Availability of high-resolution atomic structures is one of the prerequisites for a mechanistic understanding of biomolecular function. This atomic information can, however, be difficult to acquire for interesting systems such as high molecular weight and multi-subunit complexes. For these, low-resolution and/or sparse data from a variety of sources including NMR are often available to define the interaction between the subunits. To make best use of all the available information and shed light on these challenging systems, integrative computational tools are required that can judiciously combine and accurately translate the sparse experimental data into structural information. In this Perspective we discuss NMR techniques and data sources available for the modeling of large and multi-subunit complexes. Recent developments are illustrated by particularly challenging application examples taken from the literature. Within this context, we also position our data-driven docking approach, HADDOCK, which can integrate a variety of information sources to drive the modeling of biomolecular complexes. It is the synergy between experimentation and computational modeling that will provides us with detailed views on the machinery of life and lead to a mechanistic understanding of biomolecular function. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {HHpred is a fast server for remote protein homology detection and structure prediction and is the first to implement pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). It allows to search a wide choice of databases, such as the PDB, SCOP, Pfam, SMART, COGs and CDD. It accepts a single query sequence or a multiple alignment as input. Within only a few minutes it returns the search results in a user-friendly format similar to that of PSI-BLAST. Search options include local or global alignment and scoring secondary structure similarity. HHpred can produce pairwise query-template alignments, multiple alignments of the query with a set of templates selected from the search results, as well as 3D structural models that are calculated by the MODELLER software from these alignments. A detailed help facility is available. As a demonstration, we analyze the sequence of SpoVT, a transcriptional regulator from Bacillus subtilis. HHpred can be accessed at http://protevo.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred.},

abstract = {Strategies for correlation analysis in protein contact prediction often encounter two challenges, namely, the indirect coupling among residues, and the background correlations mainly caused by phylogenetic biases. While various studies have been conducted on how to disentangle indirect coupling, the removal of background correlations still remains unresolved. Here, we present an approach for removing background correlations via low-rank and sparse decomposition (LRS) of a residue correlation matrix. The correlation matrix can be constructed using either local inference strategies (e.g., mutual information, or MI) or global inference strategies (e.g., direct coupling analysis, or DCA). In our approach, a correlation matrix was decomposed into two components, i.e., a low-rank component representing background correlations, and a sparse component representing true correlations. Finally the residue contacts were inferred from the sparse component of correlation matrix. We trained our LRS-based method on the PSICOV dataset, and tested it on both GREMLIN and CASP11 datasets. Our experimental results suggested that LRS significantly improves the contact prediction precision. For example, when equipped with the LRS technique, the prediction precision of MI and mfDCA increased from 0.25 to 0.67 and from 0.58 to 0.70, respectively (Top L/10 predicted contacts, sequence separation: 5 AA, dataset: GREMLIN). In addition, our LRS technique also consistently outperforms the popular denoising technique APC (average product correction), on both local (MI_LRS: 0.67 vs MI_APC: 0.34) and global measures (mfDCA_LRS: 0.70 vs mfDCA_APC: 0.67). Interestingly, we found out that when equipped with our LRS technique, local inference strategies performed in a comparable manner to that of global inference strategies, implying that the application of LRS technique narrowed down the performance gap between local and global inference strategies. Overall, our LRS technique greatly facilitates protein contact prediction by removing background correlations. An implementation of the approach called COLORS (improving COntact prediction using LOw-Rank and Sparse matrix decomposition) is available from http://protein.ict.ac.cn/COLORS/.},

The formalism is used to derive three discriminatory functions with different types of representations for the atom-atom contacts observed in a database of protein structures. These functions include two virtual atom representations and one all-heavy atom representation. When applied to six different decoy sets containing a range of correct and incorrect conformations of amino acid sequences, the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function is able to identify correct from incorrect more often than the discriminatory functions using approximate representations. We illustrate the importance of using a detailed atomic description for obtaining the most accurate discrimination, and the necessity for testing discriminatory functions against a wide variety of decoys. The discriminatory function is also shown to be capable of capturing the fine details of atom-atom preferences. These results suggest that the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function will be useful for protein structure prediction and model refinement.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that the accuracy of ab initio structure prediction can be significantly improved by integrating evolutionary information in form of intra-protein residue-residue contacts. Following this seminal result, much effort is put into the improvement of contact predictions. However, there is also a substantial need to develop structure prediction protocols tailored to the type of restraints gained by contact predictions. Here, we present a structure prediction protocol that combines evolutionary information with the resolution-adapted structural recombination approach of Rosetta, called RASREC. Compared to the classic Rosetta ab initio protocol, RASREC achieves improved sampling, better convergence and higher robustness against incorrect distance restraints, making it the ideal sampling strategy for the stated problem. To demonstrate the accuracy of our protocol, we tested the approach on a diverse set of 28 globular proteins. Our method is able to converge for 26 out of the 28 targets and improves the average TM-score of the entire benchmark set from 0.55 to 0.72 when compared to the top ranked models obtained by the EVFold web server using identical contact predictions. Using a smaller benchmark, we furthermore show that the prediction accuracy of our method is only slightly reduced when the contact prediction accuracy is comparatively low. This observation is of special interest for protein sequences that only have a limited number of homologs.},

Sequence conservation is related to the direct evolutionary pressure to retain the chemical characteristics of some positions in order to maintain a given function. Sequence correlation is attributed to the small sequence adjustments needed to maintain protein stability against constant mutational drift. Here, we showed that sequence conservation and correlation were each frequently informative enough to detect incorrectly folded proteins. Furthermore, combining conservation, correlation, and polarity, we achieved an almost perfect discrimination between native and incorrectly folded proteins. Thus, we made use of this information for threading by evaluating the models suggested by a threading method according to the degree of proximity of the corresponding correlated, conserved, and apolar residues. The results showed that the fold recognition capacity of a given threading approach could be improved almost fourfold by selecting the alignments that score best under the three different sequence-based approaches.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent breakthroughs in protein residue-residue contact prediction have made reliable de novo prediction of protein structures possible. The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict contacts for typical alignments 35-113 times faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a CPU mode that is still 4-14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts for typical protein families can be predicted in 15-60 s on a consumer-grade GPU and 1-6 min on a six-core CPU.

abstract = {The advent of high accuracy residue-residue intra-protein contact prediction methods enabled a significant boost in the quality of de novo structure predictions. Here, we investigate the potential benefits of combining a well-established fragment-based folding algorithm – FRAGFOLD, with PSICOV, a contact prediction method which uses sparse inverse covariance estimation to identify co-varying sites in multiple sequence alignments. Using a comprehensive set of 150 diverse globular target proteins, up to 266 amino acids in length, we are able to address the effectiveness and some limitations of such approaches to globular proteins in practice. Overall we find that using fragment assembly with both statistical potentials and predicted contacts is significantly better than either statistical potentials or contacts alone. Results show up to nearly 80% of correct predictions (TM-score ≥0.5) within analysed dataset and a mean TM-score of 0.54. Unsuccessful modelling cases emerged either from conformational sampling problems, or insufficient contact prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, a strong dependency of the quality of final models on the fraction of satisfied predicted long-range contacts was observed. This not only highlights the importance of these contacts on determining the protein fold, but also (combined with other ensemble-derived qualities) provides a powerful guide as to the choice of correct models and the global quality of the selected model. A proposed quality assessment scoring function achieves 0.93 precision and 0.77 recall for the discrimination of correct folds on our dataset of decoys. These findings suggest the approach is well-suited for blind predictions on a variety of globular proteins of unknown 3D structure, provided that enough homologous sequences are available to construct a large and accurate multiple sequence alignment for the initial contact prediction step.},

abstract = {Inverse statistical approaches to determine protein structure and function from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in computational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship between the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and energetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to benchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable sequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts Hamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce many important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis reveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend not only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds; in particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization of native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing folds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred Potts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able to generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired folds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are remarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are not simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our findings elucidate the reasons for the success of inverse approaches to the modelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations.},

X-ray crystallography can utilize a low-resolution EM map for structure determination followed by phase extension to high resolution. Test studies have been conducted on five crystal structures of large molecular assemblies, in which EM maps are used as models for structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) using various standard MR packages such as AMoRe, MOLREP and Phaser. The results demonstrate that EM maps are viable models for molecular replacement. Possible difficulties in data analysis, such as the effects of the EM magnification error, and the effect of MR positional/rotational errors on phase extension are discussed.},

abstract = {We develop a procedure to characterize the association of protein structures into homodimers using coevolutionary couplings extracted from Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) in combination with Structure Based Models (SBM). Identification of dimerization contacts using DCA is more challenging than intradomain contacts since direct couplings are mixed with monomeric contacts. Therefore a systematic way to extract dimerization signals has been elusive. We provide evidence that the prediction of homodimeric complexes is possible with high accuracy for all the cases we studied which have rich sequence information. For the most accurate conformations of the structurally diverse dimeric complexes studied the mean and interfacial RMSDs are 1.95{\AA} and 1.44{\AA}, respectively. This methodology is also able to identify distinct dimerization conformations as for the case of the family of response regulators, which dimerize upon activation. The identification of dimeric complexes can provide interesting molecular insights in the construction of large oligomeric complexes and be useful in the study of aggregation related diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.},

abstract = {Proteins display a hierarchy of structural features at primary, secondary, tertiary, and higher-order levels, an organization that guides our current understanding of their biological properties and evolutionary origins. Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term "protein sectors." Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions, and structural biology has provided detailed functional insight for select 3D protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information about protein interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict protein-protein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current growth of sequences, we expect that the method can be generalized to genome-wide elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.},

In spite of steady progress over the past decade, contact prediction remains still largely unsolved. Here we develop a new contact map predictor (SVMcon) that uses support vector machines to predict medium- and long-range contacts. SVMcon integrates profiles, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact potentials, and other useful features. On the same test data set, SVMcon's accuracy is 4% higher than the latest version of the CMAPpro contact map predictor. SVMcon recently participated in the seventh edition of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7) experiment and was evaluated along with seven other contact map predictors. SVMcon was ranked as one of the top predictors, yielding the second best coverage and accuracy for contacts with sequence separation >= 12 on 13 de novo domains. We describe SVMcon, a new contact map predictor that uses SVMs and a large set of informative features. SVMcon yields good performance on medium- to long-range contact predictions and can be modularly incorporated into a structure prediction pipeline.},

However, less than 1% of membrane protein structures are in the Protein Data Bank. In this context, it is important to develop reliable computational methods for predicting the structures of membrane proteins. Here, we present the first application of random forest (RF) for residue-residue contact prediction in transmembrane proteins, which we term as TMhhcp. Rigorous cross-validation tests indicate that the built RF models provide a more favorable prediction performance compared with two state-of-the-art methods, i.e., TMHcon and MEMPACK. Using a strict leave-one-protein-out jackknifing procedure, they were capable of reaching the top L/5 prediction accuracies of 49.5% and 48.8% for two different residue contact definitions, respectively. The predicted residue contacts were further employed to predict interacting helical pairs and achieved the Matthew's correlation coefficients of 0.430 and 0.424, according to two different residue contact definitions, respectively. To facilitate the academic community, the TMhhcp server has been made freely accessible at http://protein.cau.edu.cn/tmhhcp.},

The resulting, preliminary structure serves as additional input to the second stage of the procedure, in which a new ensemble of chemical shift assignments and a refined structure are calculated. The three-dimensional structures of three 12-16 kDa proteins computed with the FLYA algorithm coincided closely with the conventionally determined structures. Deviations were below 0.95 A for the backbone atom positions, excluding the flexible chain termini. 96-97% of all backbone and side-chain chemical shifts in the structured regions were assigned to the correct residues. The purely computational FLYA method is suitable for substituting all manual spectra analysis and thus overcomes a main efficiency limitation of the NMR method for protein structure determination.},

Using N/8 simulated long-range restraints, where N is the number of residues, 1023 (75%) proteins were folded to a C(alpha) root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from native <6.5 A in one of the top five models. The average RMSD of the models for all 1365 proteins is 5.0 A. Using N/4 simulated restraints, 1206 (88%) proteins were folded to a RMSD <6.5 A and the average RMSD improved to 4.1 A. Then, 69 proteins with experimental NMR data were used. Using long-range NOE-derived restraints, 47 proteins were folded to a RMSD <6.5 A with N/8 restraints and 61 proteins were folded to a RMSD <6.5 A with N/4 restraints.

abstract = {In this work, the influence of the metal ions present in vertebrate Sonic Hedgehog was assessed by a series of molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations with differing ionic compositions. The obtained data suggest that Ca(II) binding has a very distinct influence on the composition of the protein surface surrounding the binding site by shaping several ionic interactions with negatively charged sidechains that otherwise would be pointing towards the solvent, repelling potential ligands. Furthermore, the Ca(II) ions play an important role in the stability of the loop regions where they are coordinated. In contrast, the removal of the Zn(II) ion results in no noticeable destabilization of its chemical surrounding, however, it is shown that the destabilizing effect of removed Ca(II) ions is amplified if Zn(II) is absent as well. Furthermore, a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation of Sonic Hedgehog with special focus on the Zn(II) binding site has been conducted. The results indicate that QM/MM in contrast to pure MM accurately reproduces structural features also found by experimental studies and therefore is able to provide credible predictions not only of the dynamical properties of the studied system but also of protein–ligand interactions at the metal ion binding site.},

In the series of papers that will follow the subject will be elaborated and applied to problems of interest in chemistry, such as construction of all molecular skeletons of prescribed valency distribution, construc-tion of all polyhedra of a given size, construction of cluster forms of interest in chemistry of heavy elements, and construction of two-dimensional and three-dimensional connected networks of interest in crystal chemistry. The application can be extended to struc-tures having multiple bonds and loops, as well as to directed graphs when appropriate modifications are introduced which take into account the new constraints on the adjacency matrices. Clearly, some ramifications might be of more interest for their mathematical or chemical, rather than their structural, aspect (for example, enumerating polyhedra or various isomers); as these arise they will be briefly mentioned, and the interested reader will be referred to more complete accounts of such studies presented elsewhere. A new method is described for the calculation of Cartesian coordinates for n points given the n x n matrix of interpoint distances. The algorithm is faster than some earlier methods, and it is remarkably stable with respect to both numerical roundoff errors and errors in the given distance matrix. The resultant coordinates have their origin near the center of mass and axes approximately along the three principal rotational axes. The calculation is described of distances to the center of mass directly from the distance matrix. Results of computer trials of the algorithm are given.},

abstract = {Background Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) are the key components of signal transduction, cell-cell adhesion and energy and material transport into and out from the cells. For the deep understanding of these processes, structure determination of transmembrane proteins is indispensable. However, due to technical difficulties, only a few transmembrane protein structures have been determined experimentally. Large-scale genomic sequencing provides increasing amounts of sequence information on the proteins and whole proteomes of living organisms resulting in the challenge of bioinformatics; how the structural information should be gained from a sequence. Results Here, we present a novel method, TMFoldRec, for fold prediction of membrane segments in transmembrane proteins. TMFoldRec based on statistical potentials was tested on a benchmark set containing 124 TMP chains from the PDBTM database. Using a 10-fold jackknife method, the native folds were correctly identified in 77 % of the cases. This accuracy overcomes the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a key feature of TMFoldRec algorithm is the ability to estimate the reliability of the prediction and to decide with an accuracy of 70 %, whether the obtained, lowest energy structure is the native one. Conclusion These results imply that the membrane embedded parts of TMPs dictate the TM structures rather than the soluble parts. Moreover, predictions with reliability scores make in this way our algorithm applicable for proteome-wide analyses. Availability The program is available upon request for academic use.

abstract = {Experimentally derived structural constraints have been crucial to the implementation of computational models of biomolecular dynamics. For example, not only does crystallography provide essential starting points for molecular simulations but also high-resolution structures permit for parameterization of simplified models. Since the energy landscapes for proteins and other biomolecules have been shown to be minimally frustrated and therefore funneled, these structure-based models have played a major role in understanding the mechanisms governing folding and many functions of these systems. Structural information, however, may be limited in many interesting cases. Recently, the statistical analysis of residue co-evolution in families of protein sequences has provided a complementary method of discovering residue-residue contact interactions involved in functional configurations. These functional configurations are often transient and difficult to capture experimentally. Thus, co-evolutionary information can be merged with that available for experimentally characterized low free-energy structures, in order to more fully capture the true underlying biomolecular energy landscape.},

abstract = {The structure of human protein HSPC034 has been determined by both solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Refinement of the NMR structure ensemble, using a Rosetta protocol in the absence of NMR restraints, resulted in significant improvements not only in structure quality, but also in molecular replacement (MR) performance with the raw X-ray diffraction data using MOLREP and Phaser. This method has recently been shown to be generally applicable with improved MR performance demonstrated for eight NMR structures refined using Rosetta (Qian et al., Nature 2007;450:259-264). Additionally, NMR structures of HSPC034 calculated by standard methods that include NMR restraints have improvements in the RMSD to the crystal structure and MR performance in the order DYANA, CYANA, XPLOR-NIH, and CNS with explicit water refinement (CNSw). Further Rosetta refinement of the CNSw structures, perhaps due to more thorough conformational sampling and/or a superior force field, was capable of finding alternative low energy protein conformations that were equally consistent with the NMR data according to the Recall, Precision, and F-measure (RPF) scores. On further examination, the additional MR-performance shortfall for NMR refined structures as compared with the X-ray structure were attributed, in part, to crystal-packing effects, real structural differences, and inferior hydrogen bonding in the NMR structures. A good correlation between a decrease in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and improved MR performance demonstrates the importance of hydrogen-bond terms in the force field for improving NMR structures. The superior hydrogen-bond network in Rosetta-refined structures demonstrates that correct identification of hydrogen bonds should be a critical goal of NMR structure refinement. Inclusion of nonbivalent hydrogen bonds identified from Rosetta structures as additional restraints in the structure calculation results in NMR structures with improved MR performance.},

abstract = {A new hybrid distance space-real space method for determining three-dimensional structures of proteins on the basis of interproton distance restraints is presented. It involves the following steps: (i) the approximate polypeptide fold is obtained by generating a set of substructures comprising only a small subset of atoms by projection from multi-dimensional distance space into three-dimensional cartesian coordinate space using a procedure known as 'embedding'; (ii) all remaining atoms are then added by best fitting extended amino acids one residue at a time to the substructures; (iii) the resulting structures are used as the starting point for real space dynamical simulated annealing calculations. The latter involve heating the system to a high temperature followed by slow cooling in order to overcome potential barriers along the pathway towards the global minimum region. This is carried out by solving Newton's equations of motion. Unlike conventional restrained molecular dynamics, however, the non-bonded interactions are represented by a simple van der Waals repulsion term. The method is illustrated by calculations on crambin (46 residues) and the globular domain of histone H5 (79 residues). It is shown that the hybrid method is more efficient computationally and samples a larger region of conformational space consistent with the experimental data than full metric matrix distance geometry calculations alone, particularly for large systems. © 1988.},

abstract = {An accurate scoring function is a key component for successful protein structure prediction. To address this important unsolved problem, we develop a generalized orientation and distance-dependent all-atom statistical potential. The new statistical potential, generalized orientation-dependent all-atom potential (GOAP), depends on the relative orientation of the planes associated with each heavy atom in interacting pairs. GOAP is a generalization of previous orientation-dependent potentials that consider only representative atoms or blocks of side-chain or polar atoms. GOAP is decomposed into distance- and angle-dependent contributions. The DFIRE distance-scaled finite ideal gas reference state is employed for the distance-dependent component of GOAP. GOAP was tested on 11 commonly used decoy sets containing 278 targets, and recognized 226 native structures as best from the decoys, whereas DFIRE recognized 127 targets. The major improvement comes from decoy sets that have homology-modeled structures that are close to native (all within ???4.0 ) or from the ROSETTA ab initio decoy set. For these two kinds of decoys, orientation-independent DFIRE or only side-chain orientation-dependent RWplus performed poorly. Although the OPUS-PSP block-based orientation-dependent, side-chain atom contact potential performs much better (recognizing 196 targets) than DFIRE, RWplus, and dDFIRE, it is still ???15% worse than GOAP. Thus, GOAP is a promising advance in knowledge-based, all-atom statistical potentials. GOAP is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/GOAP. ?? 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Predicting the three dimensional native state structure of a protein from its primary sequence is an unsolved grand challenge in molecular biology. Two main computational approaches have evolved to obtain the structure from the protein sequence - ab initio/de novo methods and template-based modeling - both of which typically generate multiple possible native state structures. Model quality assessment programs (MQAP) validate these predicted structures in order to identify the correct native state structure. Here, we propose a MQAP for assessing the quality of protein structures based on the distances of consecutive C$\alpha$ atoms. We hypothesize that the root-mean-square deviation of the distance of consecutive C$\alpha$ (RDCC) atoms from the ideal value of 3.8 {\AA}, derived from a statistical analysis of high quality protein structures (top100H database), is minimized in native structures. Based on tests with the top100H set, we propose a RDCC cutoff value of 0.012 {\AA}, above which a structure can be filtered out as a non-native structure. We applied the RDCC discriminator on decoy sets from the Decoys 'R' Us database to show that the native structures in all decoy sets tested have RDCC below the 0.012 {\AA} cutoff. While most decoy sets were either indistinguishable using this discriminator or had very few violations, all the decoy structures in the fisa decoy set were discriminated by applying the RDCC criterion. This highlights the physical non-viability of the fisa decoy set, and possible issues in benchmarking other methods using this set.

abstract = {The study of molecular evolution at the level of protein-coding genes often entails comparing large datasets of sequences to infer their evolutionary relationships. Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by 'hidden' conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

abstract = {Comparison of protein structures is important for revealing the evolutionary relationship among proteins, predicting protein functions and predicting protein structures. Many methods have been developed in the past to align two or multiple protein structures. Despite the importance of this problem, rigorous mathematical or statistical frameworks have seldom been pursued for general protein structure comparison. One notable issue in this field is that with many different distances used to measure the similarity between protein structures, none of them are proper distances when protein structures of different sequences are compared. Statistical approaches based on those non-proper distances or similarity scores as random variables are thus not mathematically rigorous. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for protein structure comparison by treating protein structures as three-dimensional curves. Using an elastic Riemannian metric on spaces of curves, geodesic distance, a proper distance on spaces of curves, can be computed for any two protein structures. In this framework, protein structures can be treated as random variables on the shape manifold, and means and covariance can be computed for populations of protein structures. Furthermore, these moments can be used to build Gaussian-type probability distributions of protein structures for use in hypothesis testing. The covariance of a population of protein structures can reveal the population-specific variations and be helpful in improving structure classification. With curves representing protein structures, the matching is performed using elastic shape analysis of curves, which can effectively model conformational changes and insertions/deletions. We show that our method performs comparably with commonly used methods in protein structure classification on a large manually annotated data set.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3D model for a protein (target) that is related to at least one known protein structure (template). A 3D structure of proteins from the same family is more conserved than their primary sequences. Therefore, if similarity between two proteins is detectable at the sequence level, structural similarity can usually be assumed. Comparative modeling usually starts by searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of known protein structures using the target sequence as the query. This search is generally done by comparing the target sequence with the sequence of each of the structures in the database. Comparative modeling consists of five steps: (1) search for related protein structures, (2) selection of one or more templates, (3) target–template alignment, (4) model building, and (5) model evaluation. If the model is not satisfactory, some or all of the steps can be repeated. There are several computer programs and Web servers that automate the comparative modeling process. The first Web server for automated comparative modeling was the Swiss-Model server, followed by CPHModels and ModWeb. These servers accept a sequence from a user and return an all-atom comparative model when possible.},

abstract = {Summary As methods for analysis of biomolecular structure and dynamics using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) continue to advance, the resulting 3D structures, chemical shifts, and other NMR data are broadly impacting biology, chemistry, and medicine. Structure model assessment is a critical area of NMR methods development, and is an essential component of the process of making these structures accessible and useful to the wider scientific community. For these reasons, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) has convened an NMR Validation Task Force (NMR-VTF) to work with wwPDB partners in developing metrics and policies for biomolecular NMR data harvesting, structure representation, and structure quality assessment. This paper summarizes the recommendations of the NMR-VTF, and lays the groundwork for future work in developing standards and metrics for biomolecular NMR structure quality assessment. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural prediction of protein interactions currently remains a challenging but fundamental goal. In particular, progress in scoring functions is critical for the efficient discrimination of near-native interfaces among large sets of decoys. Many functions have been developed using knowledge-based potentials, but few make use of multi-body interactions or evolutionary information, although multi-residue interactions are crucial for protein-protein binding and protein interfaces undergo significant selection pressure to maintain their interactions.\nRESULTS: This article presents InterEvScore, a novel scoring function using a coarse-grained statistical potential including two- and three-body interactions, which provides each residue with the opportunity to contribute in its most favorable local structural environment. Combination of this potential with evolutionary information considerably improves scoring results on the 54 test cases from the widely used protein docking benchmark for which evolutionary information can be collected. We analyze how our way to include evolutionary information gradually increases the discriminative power of InterEvScore. Comparison with several previously published scoring functions (ZDOCK, ZRANK and SPIDER) shows the significant progress brought by InterEvScore.\nAVAILABILITY: http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/interevscore\nCONTACT: guerois@cea.fr\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

They use (i) large sets of multiple aligned sequences and (ii) assume that correlations between columns in these alignments can be the results of indirect interaction. These methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when it comes to predicting contacts in proteins. Here, we demonstrate that combining predictions from two prediction methods, PSICOV and plmDCA, and two alignment methods, HHblits and jackhmmer at four different e-value cut-offs, provides a relative improvement of 20% in comparison with the best single method, exceeding 70% correct predictions for one contact prediction per residue.

The protocol is described in detail and illustrated on a resonance assignment and structure determination of the FK506 binding protein (FKBP, 107 amino acids) complexed to the immunosuppressant, ascomycin. The 3D structures produced from this automated protocol attained backbone and heavy atom rmsd of 1.17 and 1.69 A, respectively. Although more highly resolved structures of the complex have been obtained by standard interpretation of NMR data (Meadows et al. (1993) Biochemistry, 32, 754-765), the structures generated with this automated protocol required minimal manual intervention during the spectral assignment and 3D structure calculations stages.

abstract = {The major feature of many proteins is a large beta-sheet that twists and coils to form a closed structure in which the first strand is hydrogen bonded to the last: the beta-sheet barrel. McLachlan classified barrels in terms of two integral parameters: the number of strands in the beta-sheet, n, and the "shear number", S, a measure of the stagger of the strands in the beta-sheet. He showed that the mean radius of a barrel and the extent to which strands are tilted relative to its axis are determined by the values of n and S. Here we show that the (n, S) values determine all the other general structural features of regular beta-sheet barrels, in particular, optimal values of the twist and coiling angles that produce the closed beta-sheet, the hyperboloidal shape and the arrangement of residues in the barrel interior. Consideration of the residue arrangements in the interiors of different potential barrel structures, and of side-chain volumes, suggest that barrels, in which the interiors are close packed by the residues in beta-sheets with good geometries, have structures that correspond to one of only ten different combinations of n and S. In the accompanying paper, we demonstrate, by an analysis of all observed protein structures that contain beta-sheet barrels and for which atomic co-ordinates are available, the validity of these theoretical results.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

abstract = {The protein-protein docking problem is one of the focal points of activity in computational biophysics and structural biology. The three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally, is more difficult to determine experimentally than the structure of an individual protein. Adequate computational techniques to model protein interactions are important because of the growing number of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution, experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures. Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments of predictive methodologies. The development of more powerful and adequate docking approaches is facilitated by rapidly expanding information and data resources, growing computational capabilities, and a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of protein interactions.},

abstract = {Single-particle cryo-EM is a powerful approach to determine the structure of large macromolecules and assemblies thereof in many cases at subnanometer resolution. It has become popular to refine or flexibly fit atomic models into density maps derived from cryo-EM experiments. These density maps are typically significantly lower in resolution than electron density maps obtained from X-ray diffraction experiments, such that the number of parameters that need to be determined is much larger than the number of experimental observables. Overfitting and misinterpretation of the density, thus, become a serious problem. For diffraction data, a cross-validation approach was introduced almost 20 y ago; however, no such approach has been described yet for structure refinement against cryo-EM density maps, although the overfitting problem is, because of the lower resolution, significantly larger. We present a cross-validation approach for real-space refinement against cryo-EM density maps in analogy to cross-validation typically used in crystallography. Our approach is able to detect overfitting and allows for optimizing the choice of restraints used in the refinement. The approach is shown on three protein structures with simulated data and experimental data of the rotavirus double-layer particle. Because cross-validation requires splitting the dataset into at least two independent sets, we further present an approach to quantify correlations between the structure factor sets. This analysis is also helpful for other cross-validation applications, such as refinements against diffraction data or 3D reconstructions of cryo-EM density maps.},

Some computational methods treat this problem as a ranking problem, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, such as PSI-BLAST, HHblits, and ProtEmbed. This raises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive performance. In this regard, we are to propose a new computational method called ProtDec-LTR for protein remote homology detection, which is able to combine various ranking methods in a supervised manner via using the Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithm derived from natural language processing. Results: Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that ProtDec-LTR can achieve an ROC1 score of 0.8442, and an ROC50 score of 0.9023 outperforming all the individual predictors and some state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that it is correct to treat protein remote homology detection as a ranking problem, and predictive performance improvement can be achieved by combining different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via using Learning to Rank.

abstract = {The use of generous distance bounds has been the hallmark of NMR structure determination. However, bounds necessitate the estimation of data quality before the calculation, reduce the information content, introduce human bias, and allow for major errors in the structures. Here, we propose a new rapid structure calculation scheme based on Bayesian analysis. The minimization of an extended energy function, including a new type of distance restraint and a term depending on the data quality, results in an estimation of the data quality in addition to coordinates. This allows for the determination of the optimal weight on the experimental information. The resulting structures are of better quality and closer to the X-ray crystal structure of the same molecule. With the new calculation approach, the analysis of discrepancies from the target distances becomes meaningful. The strategy may be useful in other applications-for example, in homology modeling. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: All residues in a protein are not equally important. Some are essential for the proper structure and function of the protein, whereas others can be readily replaced. Conservation analysis is one of the most widely used methods for predicting these functionally important residues in protein sequences. RESULTS: We introduce an information-theoretic approach for estimating sequence conservation based on Jensen-Shannon divergence. We also develop a general heuristic that considers the estimated conservation of sequentially neighboring sites. In large-scale testing, we demonstrate that our combined approach outperforms previous conservation-based measures in identifying functionally important residues; in particular, it is significantly better than the commonly used Shannon entropy measure. We find that considering conservation at sequential neighbors improves the performance of all methods tested. Our analysis also reveals that many existing methods that attempt to incorporate the relationships between amino acids do not lead to better identification of functionally important sites. Finally, we find that while conservation is highly predictive in identifying catalytic sites and residues near bound ligands, it is much less effective in identifying residues in protein-protein interfaces. AVAILABILITY: Data sets and code for all conservation measures evaluated are available at http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/conservation/},

For the Critical Assessment of Techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) 11, we have built a protocol of protein structure prediction that has novel coarse-grained scoring functions for selecting decoys as the heart of its pipeline. The score named PRESCO (Protein Residue Environment SCOre) developed recently by our group evaluates the native-likeness of local structural environment of residues in a structure decoy considering positions and the depth of side-chains of spatially neighboring residues. We also introduced a helix interaction potential as an additional scoring function for selecting decoys. The best models selected by PRESCO and the helix interaction potential underwent structure refinement, which includes side-chain modeling and relaxation with a short molecular dynamics simulation. Our protocol was successful, achieving the top rank in the free modeling category with a significant margin of the accumulated Z-score to the subsequent groups when the top 1 models were considered.

abstract = {We have used a novel, largely automated, calculation method to refine the NMR solution structure of the pleckstrin homology domain of $\beta$-spectrin. The method is called ARIA for Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment. The starting point for ARIA is an almost complete assignment of the proton chemical shifts, and a list of partially assigned NOEs, mostly sequential and secondary structure NOEs. The restraint list is then augmented by automatically interpreting peak lists generated by automated peak-picking. The central task of ARIA is the assignment of ambiguous NOEs during the structure calculation using a combination of ambiguous distance restraints and an iterative assignment strategy. In addition, ARIA calibrates ambiguous NOEs to derive distance restraints, merges overlapping data sets to remove duplicate information, and uses empirical rules to identify erroneous peaks. While the distance restraints for the structure calculations were exclusively extracted from homonuclear 2D experiments, ARIA is especially suited for the analysis of multidimensional spectra. Applied to the pleckstrin homology domain, ARIA generated structures of good quality, and of sufficiently high accuracy to solve the X-ray crystal structure of the same domain by molecular replacement. The comparison of the free NMR solution structure to the X-ray structure, which is complexed to d-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate, shows that the ligand primarily induces a disorder-order transition in the binding loops, which are disordered in the NMR ensemble but well ordered in the crystal. The structural core of the protein is unaffected, as evidenced by a backbone root-mean-square difference between the average NMR coordinates and the X-ray crystal structure for the secondary structure elements of less than 0.6 {\AA}.},

The application of a protocol for combining these independent variables leads to contact predictions that are on average two times better than those obtained initially with correlated mutations.

The increasing number of available three-dimensional structures of protein-protein complexes has enabled large-scale statistical analyses of protein interfaces, considering evolutionary, physicochemical and structural properties. Successful combinations of these properties have led to more accurate interface predictors in recent years. In addition to parametric combination, machine learning algorithms have become popular. In the meantime, assessing the absolute and relative performance of interface predictors remains very difficult: This is due to differences in both the output of the various interface predictors, and in the evaluation criteria used by their respective authors. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in the field, and discusses the performance of existing interface predictors. The focus is mainly on protein-protein interface prediction, although most issues are also valid for other kinds of interface prediction.},

@article{Simkovic2017,
abstract = {Evolutionary pressure on residue interactions, intramolecular or intermolecular, that are important for protein structure or function can lead to covariance between the two positions. Recent methodological advances allow much more accurate contact predictions to be derived from this evolutionary covariance signal. The practical application of contact predictions has largely been confined to structural bioinformatics, yet, as this work seeks to demonstrate, the data can be of enormous value to the structural biologist working in X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM or NMR. Integrative structural bioinformatics packages such as Rosetta can already exploit contact predictions in a variety of ways. The contribution of contact predictions begins at construct design, where structural domains may need to be expressed separately and contact predictions can help to predict domain limits. Structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) benefits from contact predictions in diverse ways: in difficult cases, more accurate search models can be constructed using ab initio modelling when predictions are available, while intermolecular contact predictions can allow the construction of larger, oligomeric search models. Furthermore, MR using supersecondary motifs or large-scale screens against the PDB can exploit information, such as the parallel or antiparallel nature of any $\beta$-strand pairing in the target, that can be inferred from contact predictions. Contact information will be particularly valuable in the determination of lower resolution structures by helping to assign sequence register. In large complexes, contact information may allow the identity of a protein responsible for a certain region of density to be determined and then assist in the orientation of an available model within that density. In NMR, predicted contacts can provide long-range information to extend the upper size limit of the technique in a manner analogous but complementary to experimental methods. Finally, predicted contacts can distinguish between biologically relevant interfaces and mere lattice contacts in a final crystal structure, and have potential in the identification of functionally important regions and in foreseeing the consequences of mutations.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {Transmembrane $\beta$-barrels (TMBs) carry out major functions in substrate transport and protein biogenesis but experimental determination of their 3D structure is challenging. Encouraged by successful de novo 3D structure prediction of globular and $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments alone, we developed an approach to predict the 3D structure of TMBs. The approach combines the maximum-entropy evolutionary coupling method for predicting residue contacts (EVfold) with a machine-learning approach (boctopus2) for predicting $\beta$-strands in the barrel. In a blinded test for 19 TMB proteins of known structure that have a sufficient number of diverse homologous sequences available, this combined method (EVfold_bb) predicts hydrogen-bonded residue pairs between adjacent $\beta$-strands at an accuracy of ∼70%. This accuracy is sufficient for the generation of all-atom 3D models. In the transmembrane barrel region, the average 3D structure accuracy [template-modeling (TM) score] of top-ranked models is 0.54 (ranging from 0.36 to 0.85), with a higher (44%) number of residue pairs in correct strand-strand registration than in earlier methods (18%). Although the nonbarrel regions are predicted less accurately overall, the evolutionary couplings identify some highly constrained loop residues and, for FecA protein, the barrel including the structure of a plug domain can be accurately modeled (TM score = 0.68). Lower prediction accuracy tends to be associated with insufficient sequence information and we therefore expect increasing numbers of $\beta$-barrel families to become accessible to accurate 3D structure prediction as the number of available sequences increases.},

abstract = {The model quality assessment problem consists in the a priori estimation of the overall and per-residue accuracy of protein structure predictions. Over the past years, a number of methods have been developed to address this issue and CASP established a prediction category to evaluate their performance in 2006. In 2008 the experiment was repeated and its results are reported here. Participants were invited to infer the correctness of the protein models submitted by the registered automatic servers. Estimates could apply to both whole models and individual amino acids. Groups involved in the tertiary structure prediction categories were also asked to assign local error estimates to each predicted residue in their own models and their results are also discussed here. The correlation between the predicted and observed correctness measures was the basis of the assessment of the results. We observe that consensus-based methods still perform significantly better than those accepting single models, similarly to what was concluded in the previous edition of the experiment.},

abstract = {The amino acid sequences of the protonmotive cytochrome b from seven representative and phylogenetically diverse species have been compared to identify protein regions or segments that are conserved during evolution. The sequences analyzed included both prokaryotic and eukaryotic examples as well as mitochondrial cytochrome b and chloroplast b6 proteins. The principal conclusion from these analyses is that there are five protein regions-each comprising about 20 amino acid residues-that are consistently conserved during evolution. These domains are evident despite the low density of invariant residues. The two most highly conserved regions, spanning approximately consensus residues 130-150 and 270-290, are located in extramembrane loops and are hypothesized to constitute part of the Qo reaction center. The intramembrane, hydrophobic protein regions containing the heme-ligating histidines are also conserved during evolution. It was found, however, that the conservation of the protein segments extramembrane to the histidine residues ligating the low potential b566 heme group showed a higher degree of sequence conservation. The location of these conserved regions suggests that these extramembrane segments are also involved in forming the Qo reaction center. A protein segment putatively constituting a portion of the Qi reaction center, located approximately in the region spanned by consensus residues 20-40, is conserved in species as divergent as mouse and Rhodobacter. This region of the protein shows substantially less sequence conservation in the chloroplast cytochrome b6. The catalytic role of these conserved regions is strongly supported by locations of residues that are altered in mutants resistant to inhibitors of cytochrome b electron transport.},

In this chapter, we present the Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment (ARIA) program for automated cross-peak assignment and determination of macromolecular structure from solution and solid-state NMR experiments. While the program was initially designed for the assignment of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) resonances, it has been extended to the interpretation of magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR data. This chapter first details the concepts and procedures carried out by the program. Then, we describe both the general strategy for structure determination with ARIA 2.3 and practical aspects of the technique.

abstract = {An adequate set of computer procedures tailored to address the task of genome-scale analysis of protein sequences will greatly increase the beneficial impact of the genome sequencing projects on the progress of biological research. This is especially pertinent given the fact that, for model organisms, one-half or more of the putative gene products have not been functionally characterized. Here we described several programs that may comprise the core of such a set and their application to the analysis of about 3000 proteins comprising 75% of the E. coli gene products. We find that the protein sequences encoded in this model genome are a rich source of information, with biologically relevant similarities detected for more than 80% of them. In the majority of cases, these similarities become evident directly from the results of BLAST searches. However, methods for motif analysis provide for a significant increase in search sensitivity and are particularly important for the detection of ancient conserved regions. As a result of sequence similarity analysis, generalized functional predictions can be made for the majority of uncharacterized ORF products, allowing efficient focusing of experimental effort. Clustering of the E. coli proteins on the basis of sequence similarity shows that almost one-half of the bacterial proteins have at least one paralog and that the likelihood that a protein belongs to a small or a large cluster depends on the function of this particular protein.},

We show that a molecular layer seen in crystal structures of E- and N-cadherin ectodomains reported here and in a previous C-cadherin structure corresponds to the extracellular architecture of adherens junctions. In all three ectodomain crystals, cadherins dimerize through a trans adhesive interface and are connected by a second, cis, interface. Assemblies formed by E-cadherin ectodomains coated on liposomes also appear to adopt this structure. Fluorescent imaging of junctions formed from wild-type and mutant E-cadherins in cultured cells confirm conclusions derived from structural evidence. Mutations that interfere with the trans interface ablate adhesion, whereas cis interface mutations disrupt stable junction formation. Our observations are consistent with a model for junction assembly involving strong trans and weak cis interactions localized in the ectodomain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use and importance of predicted protein residue-residue contacts has grown considerably with demonstrated applications such as drug design, protein tertiary structure prediction and model quality assessment. Nevertheless, reported accuracies in the range of 25-35% stubbornly remain the norm for sequence based, long range contact predictions on hard targets. This is in spite of a prolonged effort on behalf of the community to improve the performance of residue-residue contact prediction. A thorough study of the quality of current residue-residue contact predictions and the evaluation metrics used as well as an analysis of current methods is needed to stimulate further advancement in contact prediction and its application. Such a study will better explain the quality and nature of residue-residue contact predictions generated by current methods and as a result lead to better use of this contact information.\n\nRESULTS: We evaluated several sequence based residue-residue contact predictors that participated in the tenth Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment. The evaluation was performed using standard assessment techniques such as those used by the official CASP assessors as well as two novel evaluation metrics (i.e., cluster accuracy and cluster count). An in-depth analysis revealed that while most residue-residue contact predictions generated are not accurate at the residue level, there is quite a strong contact signal present when allowing for less than residue level precision. Our residue-residue contact predictor, DNcon, performed particularly well achieving an accuracy of 66% for the top L/10 long range contacts when evaluated in a neighbourhood of size 2. The coverage of residue-residue contact areas was also greater with DNcon when compared to other methods. We also provide an analysis of DNcon with respect to its underlying architecture and features used for classification.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel evaluation metrics demonstrate that current residue-residue contact predictions do contain a strong contact signal and are of better quality than standard evaluation metrics indicate. Our method, DNcon, is a robust, state-of-the-art residue-residue sequence based contact predictor and excelled under a number of evaluation schemes.

abstract = {Eukaryotic proteins with important biological function can be partially unstructured, conformational flexible, or heterogenic. Crystallization trials often fail for such proteins. In NMR spectroscopy, parts of the polypeptide chain undergoing dynamics in unfavorable time regimes cannot be observed. De novo NMR structure determination is seriously hampered when missing signals lead to an incomplete chemical shift assignment resulting in an information content of the NOE data insufficient to determine the structure ab initio. We developed a new protein structure determination strategy for such cases based on a novel NOE assignment strategy utilizing a number of model structures but no explicit reference structure as it is used for bootstrapping like algorithms. The software distinguishes in detail between consistent and mutually exclusive pairs of possible NOE assignments on the basis of different precision levels of measured chemical shifts searching for a set of maximum number of consistent NOE assignments in agreement with 3D space. Validation of the method using the structure of the low molecular-weight-protein tyrosine phosphatase A (MptpA) showed robust results utilizing protein structures with 30-45% sequence identity and 70% of the chemical shift assignments. About 60% of the resonance assignments are sufficient to identify those structural models with highest conformational similarity to the real structure. The software was benchmarked by de novo solution structures of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and the extracellular fibroblast growth factor receptor domain FGFR4 D2, which both failed in crystallization trials and in classical NMR structure determination.},

abstract = {We examine the information-theoretic characteristics of statistical potentials that describe pairwise long-range contacts between amino acid residues in proteins. In our work, we seek to map out an efficient information-based strategy to detect and optimally utilize the structural information latent in empirical data, to make contact potentials, and other statistically derived folding potentials, more effective tools in protein structure prediction. Foremost, we establish fundamental connections between basic information-theoretic quantities (including the ubiquitous Z-score) and contact "energies" or scores used routinely in protein structure prediction, and demonstrate that the informatic quantity that mediates fold discrimination is the total divergence. We find that pairwise contacts between residues bear a moderate amount of fold information, and if optimized, can assist in the discrimination of native conformations from large ensembles of native-like decoys. Using an extensive battery of threading tests, we demonstrate that parameters that affect the information content of contact potentials (e.g., choice of atoms to define residue location and the cut-off distance between pairs) have a significant influence in their performance in fold recognition. We conclude that potentials that have been optimized for mutual information and that have high number of score events per sequence-structure alignment are superior in identifying the correct fold. We derive the quantity "information product" that embodies these two critical factors. We demonstrate that the information product, which does not require explicit threading to compute, is as effective as the Z-score, which requires expensive decoy threading to evaluate. This new objective function may be able to speed up the multidimensional parameter search for better statistical potentials. Lastly, by demonstrating the functional equivalence of quasi-chemically approximated "energies" to fundamental informatic quantities, we make statistical potentials less dependent on theoretically tenuous biophysical formalisms and more amenable to direct bioinformatic optimization.},

The method employs a high-coordination lattice representation of the protein chain that incorporates a variety of potentials designed to produce protein-like behaviour. These include statistical preferences for secondary structure, side-chain burial interactions, and a hydrogen-bond potential. Using this algorithm, several globular proteins (1ctf, 2gbl, 2trx, 3fxn, 1mba, 1pcy and 6pti) have been folded to moderate-resolution, native-like compact states. For example, the 68 residue 1ctf molecule having ten loosely defined, long-range restraints was reproducibly obtained with a C alpha-backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from native of about 4. A. Flavodoxin with 35 restraints has been folded to structures whose average RMSD is 4.28 A. Furthermore, using just 20 restraints, myoglobin, which is a 146 residue helical protein, has been folded to structures whose average RMSD from native is 5.65 A. Plastocyanin with 25 long-range restraints adopts conformations whose average RMSD is 5.44 A. Possible applications of the proposed approach to the refinement of structures from NMR data, homology model-building and the determination of tertiary structure when the secondary structure and a small number of restraints are predicted are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Effective interresidue contact energies for proteins in solution are estimated from the numbers of residue-residue contacts observed in crystal structures of globular proteins by means of the quasi-chemical approximation with an approximate treatment of the effects of chain connectivity. Employing a lattice model, each residue of a protein is assumed to occupy a site in a lattice and vacant sites are regarded to be occupied by an effective solvent molecule whose size is equal to the average size of a residue. A basic assumption is that the average characteristics of residue-residue contacts formed in a large number of protein crystal structures reflcct actual differences of interactions among residues, as if there were no significant contribution from the specific amino acid sequence in each protein as well as intraresidue and short-range interactions. Then, taking account of the effects of the chain connectivity only as imposing a limit to the size of the system, Le., the number of lattice sites or the number of effective solvent molecules in the system, the system is regarded to be the mixture of unconnected residues and effective solvent molecules. The quasi-chemical approximation, that contact pair formation resembles a chemical reaction, is applied to this system to obtain formulas that relate the statistical averages of the numbers of contacts to the contact energies. The number of effective solvent molecules for each protein is chosen to yield the total number of residue-residue contacts equal to its expected value for the hypothetical case of hard sphere interactions among residues and effective solvent molecules; the expected number of residue-residue contacts at this condition has been crudely estimated by means of a freely jointed chain distribution and an expansion originating in hard sphere interactions. Each residue is represented by the center of its side chain atom positions, and contacts among residues and effective solvent molecules are defined to be those pairs within 6.5 A, a distance that has been chosen on the basis of the observed radial distribution of residues; nearest-neighbor pairs along a chain are explicitly excluded in counting contacts. Coordination numbers, for each type of residue as well as for solvent molecules, are estimated from the mean volume of each type of residue and used to evaluate the numbers of residue-solvent and solvent-solvent contacts from the numbers of residue-residue contacts. The estimated values of contact energies have reasonable residue-type dependences, reflecting residue distributions in protein crystals; nonpolar-residue-in and polar-residue-out are seen as well as the segregation of those residue groups. In addition, there is a linear relationship between the average contact energies for nonpolar residues and their hydrophobicities reported by Nozaki and Tanford; however, the magnitudes on average are about twice as large. The relevance of results to protein folding and other applications are discussed.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Co-evolution methods have been used as contact predictors to identify pairs of residues that share spatial proximity. Such contact predictors have been compared in terms of the precision of their predictions, but there is no study that compares their usefulness to model generation. RESULTS We compared eight different co-evolution methods for a set of ∼3500 proteins and found that metaPSICOV stage 2 produces, on average, the most precise predictions. Precision of all the methods is dependent on SCOP class, with most methods predicting contacts in all $\alpha$ and membrane proteins poorly. The contact predictions were then used to assist in de novo model generation. We found that it was not the method with the highest average precision, but rather metaPSICOV stage 1 predictions that consistently led to the best models being produced. Our modelling results show a correlation between the proportion of predicted long range contacts that are satisfied on a model and its quality. We used this proportion to effectively classify models as correct/incorrect; discarding decoys classified as incorrect led to an enrichment in the proportion of good decoys in our final ensemble by a factor of seven. For 17 out of the 18 cases where correct answers were generated, the best models were not discarded by this approach. We were also able to identify eight cases where no correct decoy had been generated.

abstract = {Predictive understanding of the myriads of signal transduction pathways in a cell is an outstanding challenge of systems biology. Such pathways are primarily mediated by specific but transient protein-protein interactions, which are difficult to study experimentally. In this study, we dissect the specificity of protein-protein interactions governing two-component signaling (TCS) systems ubiquitously used in bacteria. Exploiting the large number of sequenced bacterial genomes and an operon structure which packages many pairs of interacting TCS proteins together, we developed a computational approach to extract a molecular interaction code capturing the preferences of a small but critical number of directly interacting residue pairs. This code is found to reflect physical interaction mechanisms, with the strongest signal coming from charged amino acids. It is used to predict the specificity of TCS interaction: Our results compare favorably to most available experimental results, including the prediction of 7 (out of 8 known) interaction partners of orphan signaling proteins in Caulobacter crescentus. Surveying among the available bacterial genomes, our results suggest 15 approximately 25% of the TCS proteins could participate in out-of-operon "crosstalks". Additionally, we predict clusters of crosstalking candidates, expanding from the anecdotally known examples in model organisms. The tools and results presented here can be used to guide experimental studies towards a system-level understanding of two-component signaling.},

However, a critical piece of information for modeling atomic structures is missing, because there are no tools to detect $\beta$ strands from cryo-EM maps at medium resolutions. We propose a method, StrandTwister, to detect the traces of $\beta$ strands through the analysis of twist, an intrinsic nature of a $\beta$ sheet. StrandTwister has been tested using 100 $\beta$ sheets simulated at 10 {\AA} resolution and 39 $\beta$ sheets computationally detected from cryo-EM density maps at 4.4–7.4 {\AA} resolutions. Although experimentally derived cryo-EM maps contain errors, StrandTwister’s best detections over 39 cases were able to detect 81.87% of the $\beta$ strands, with an overall 1.66 {\AA} two-way distance between the detected and observed $\beta$ traces. StrandTwister appears to detect the traces of $\beta$ strands on major $\beta$ sheets quite accurately, particularly at the central area of a $\beta$ sheet.},

abstract = {Residue contact map is essential for protein three-dimensional structure determination. But most of the current contact prediction methods based on residue co-evolution suffer from high false-positives as introduced by indirect and transitive contacts (i.e., residues A-B and B-C are in contact, but A-C are not). Built on the work by Feizi et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2013; 31:726-733), which demonstrated a general network model to distinguish direct dependencies by network deconvolution, this study presents a new balanced network deconvolution (BND) algorithm to identify optimized dependency matrix without limit on the eigenvalue range in the applied network systems. The algorithm was used to filter contact predictions of five widely used co-evolution methods. On the test of proteins from three benchmark datasets of the 9th critical assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP9), CASP10, and PSICOV (precise structural contact prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation) database experiments, the BND can improve the medium- and long-range contact predictions at the L/5 cutoff by 55.59% and 47.68%, respectively, without additional central processing unit cost. The improvement is statistically significant, with a P-value < 5.93 × 10(-3) in the Student's t-test. A further comparison with the ab initio structure predictions in CASPs showed that the usefulness of the current co-evolution-based contact prediction to the three-dimensional structure modeling relies on the number of homologous sequences existing in the sequence databases. BND can be used as a general contact refinement method, which is freely available at: http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/BND/.},

@article{Kuszewski1996,
abstract = {A new conformational database potential involving dihedral angle relationships in databases of high-resolution highly refined protein crystal structures is presented as a method for improving the quality of structures generated from NMR data. The rationale for this procedure is based on the observation that uncertainties in the description of the nonbonded contacts present a key limiting factor in the attainable accuracy of protein NMR structures and that the nonbonded interaction terms presently used have poor discriminatory power between high- and low-probability local conformations. The idea behind the conformational database potential is to restrict sampling during simulated annealing refinement to conformations that are likely to be energetically possible by effectively limiting the choices of dihedral angles to those that are known to be physically realizable. In this manner, the variability in the structures produced by this method is primarily a function of the experimental restraints, rather than an artifact of a poor nonbonded interaction model. We tested this approach with the experimental NMR data (comprising an average of about 30 restraints per residue and consisting of interproton distances, torsion angles, 3JHN alpha coupling constants, and 13C chemical shifts) used previously to calculate the solution structure of reduced human thioredoxin (Qin J, Clore GM, Gronenborn AM, 1994, Structure 2:503-522). Incorporation of the conformational database potential into the target function used for refinement (which also includes terms for the experimental restraints, covalent geometry, and nonbonded interactions in the form of either a repulsive, repulsive-attractive, or 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential) results in a significant improvement in various quantitative measures of quality (Ramachandran plot, side-chain torsion angles, overall packing). This is achieved without compromising the agreement with the experimental restraints and the deviations from idealized covalent geometry that remain within experimental error, and the agreement between calculated and observed 1H chemical shifts that provides an independent NMR parameter of accuracy. The method is equally applicable to crystallographic refinement, and should be particular useful during the early stages of either an NMR or crystallographic structure determination and in cases where relatively few experimental restraints can be derived from the measured data (due, for example, to broad lines in the NMR spectra or to poorly diffracting crystals).},

@article{rogen_extracting_2013,
abstract = {Protein structure prediction techniques proceed in two steps, namely the generation of many structural models for the protein of interest, followed by an evaluation of all these models to identify those that are native-like. In theory, the second step is easy, as native structures correspond to minima of their free energy surfaces. It is well known however that the situation is more complicated as the current force fields used for molecular simulations fail to recognize native states from misfolded structures. In an attempt to solve this problem, we follow an alternate approach and derive a new potential from geometric knowledge extracted from native and misfolded conformers of protein structures. This new potential, Metric Protein Potential (MPP), has two main features that are key to its success. Firstly, it is composite in that it includes local and nonlocal geometric information on proteins. At the short range level, it captures and quantifies the mapping between the sequences and structures of short (7-mer) fragments of protein backbones through the introduction of a new local energy term. The local energy term is then augmented with a nonlocal residue-based pairwise potential, and a solvent potential. Secondly, it is optimized to yield a maximized correlation between the energy of a structural model and its root mean square (RMS) to the native structure of the corresponding protein. We have shown that MPP yields high correlation values between RMS and energy and that it is able to retrieve the native structure of a protein from a set of high-resolution decoys.

abstract = {Motivation: Recently it has been shown that the quality of protein contact prediction from evolutionary information can be improved significantly if direct and indirect information is separated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact predictions contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many protein families. However, since the first studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask how much the final models are improved if improved contact predictions are used. Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33% using PconsFold compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that the quality is improved with 15-30% when using PconsC in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further, using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with Rosetta is improved. Availability: PconsFold is a fully automated pipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based on evolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact prediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its modularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged.

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

abstract = {Here, we provide an analysis of molecular evolution of five of the most populated protein folds: immunoglobulin fold, oligonucleotide-binding fold, Rossman fold, alpha/beta plait, and TIM barrels. In order to distinguish between "historic", functional and structural reasons for amino acid conservations, we consider proteins that acquire the same fold and have no evident sequence homology. For each fold we identify positions that are conserved within each individual family and coincide when non-homologous proteins are structurally superimposed. As a baseline for statistical assessment we use the conservatism expected based on the solvent accessibility. The analysis is based on a new concept of "conservatism-of-conservatism". This approach allows us to identify the structural features that are stabilized in all proteins having a given fold, despite the fact that actual interactions that provide such stabilization may vary from protein to protein. Comparison with experimental data on thermodynamics, folding kinetics and function of the proteins reveals that such universally conserved clusters correspond to either: (i) super-sites (common location of active site in proteins having common tertiary structures but not function) or (ii) folding nuclei whose stability is an important determinant of folding rate, or both (in the case of Rossman fold). The analysis also helps to clarify the relation between folding and function that is apparent for some folds.},

We formulate the problem as the inverse of network convolution, and introduce an algorithm that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed-form solution by exploiting eigen-decomposition and infinite-series sums. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications: distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory networks; recognizing directly interacting amino-acid residues for protein structure prediction from sequence alignments; and distinguishing strong collaborations in co-authorship social networks using connectivity information alone. In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, our results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biomolecules. Protein-protein interfaces hold key information toward molecular understanding of protein function. In the past few years, there have been intensive efforts in developing methods for predicting protein interface residues. A review that presents the current status of interface prediction and an overview of its applications and project future developments is in order. SUMMARY Interface prediction methods rely on a wide range of sequence, structural and physical attributes that distinguish interface residues from non-interface surface residues. The input data are manipulated into either a numerical value or a probability representing the potential for a residue to be inside a protein interface. Predictions are now satisfactory for complex-forming proteins that are well represented in the Protein Data Bank, but less so for under-represented ones. Future developments will be directed at tackling problems such as building structural models for multi-component structural complexes.},

@article{Nilges1995,
abstract = {The distances derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectra are usually converted into three-dimensional structures by computer algorithms loosely termed distance geometry. To a varying degree, these methods require that the distance data is unambiguously assigned to pairs of atoms. Typically, however, there are many NOE crosspeaks that cannot be assigned without some knowledge of the structure. These crosspeaks have to be assigned in an iterative manner, using preliminary structures calculated from the unambiguous crosspeaks. In this paper, I present an alternative to this iterative approach. The ambiguity of an NOE crosspeak is correctly described in terms of the distances between all pairs of protons that may be involved. A simple restraining term is defined in terms of "ambiguous" distance restraints that can allow all possible assignments. A new minimization procedure based on simulated annealing is described that is capable of using highly ambiguous data for ab initio structure calculations. In particular, it is feasible to specify the restraint list directly in terms of the proton chemical shift assignment and the NOE peak table, without having assigned NOE crosspeaks to proton pairs. While the primary aim of this paper is determining the global fold of proteins from NMR data, similar strategies can be used for other types of ambiguous distance data. The application to one example, disulphide bridges with unknown connectivity, is described. Model NOE data were generated from the X-ray crystal structure of a small protein with known chemical shift assignments. Varying degrees of ambiguity in the data were assumed. The method obtained the correct polypeptide fold even when all distance restraints were ambiguous. Thus, the new approach may facilitate structure calculations with data derived from very overlapped spectra. It is also a step towards automating the calculation of structures from NMR data. This could prove especially valuable for data derived from three- and four-dimensional experiments. The approach may also prove useful for model building studies and tertiary structure prediction.},

Contact maps can be used for the reconstruction of structure with high accuracy and can be predicted from the amino acid sequence. Therefore understanding the various properties of contact maps is an important step in protein structure prediction. For investigating basic properties of contact formation and contact clusters we set up an integrated system called Contact Map Web Viewer, or CMWeb for short. The server can be used to visualize contact maps, to link contacts and to show them both in 3D structures and in multiple sequence alignments and to calculate various statistics on contacts. Moreover, we have implemented five contact prediction methods in the CMWeb server to visualize the predicted and real RR contacts in one contact map. The results of other RR contact prediction methods can be uploaded as a benchmark test onto the server as well. All of these functionality is behind a web server, thus for using our application only a Java-capable web browser is needed, no further program installation is required.

They find these molecules so interesting because, unlike cytochrome c, globins appear to have very few invariant amino acids. The paper begins, however, with an effort to rebut their critics from two major scientific communities: organismal evolutionists on one hand (especially G.G. Simpson see Simpson 1964), who argue that evolution takes place at the level of the whole organism; and "pure" biochemists on the other, who see no value in reconstructing phylogenies at all. A major portion of this article is devoted to theorizing about what makes a peptide site variant or invariant. They also take up the issue of whether it is possible to express evolutionary transformations at the molecular level simply as a function of time. They conclude that, "So far, the refutations of the time function e.g. Mayr and Simpson's arguments that evolution is too complicated and historically contingent have been weaker than its formulations." As such, they concur with Margoliash and Smith that the use of numbers of differences between polypeptide chains in order to determine evolutionary relationships is valid. In applying this method to their globin data, they find that there seems to be a constant rate of evolution in most non-functional polypeptide regions. This leads the to the conclusion that "there may thus exist a molecular evolutionary clock},

We then use these correlations to predict contact maps for each of 11 protein families and compare the result with the contacts determined by crystallography. For the most strongly correlated residue pairs predicted to be in contact, the prediction accuracy ranges from 37 to 68% and the improvement ratio relative to a random prediction from 1.4 to 5.1.

The structures and functions of proteins unlock the secrets inherent in genomes, including the human genome. The emphasis of this book is on protein architecture, on proteins as three-dimensional patterns. A new field, bioinformatics, has grown up around gene and protein sequences and structures. It has captured the interest of many scientists for its intellectual challenges, its potential for useful applications, and promising scope for careers. This book introduces the use of the World Wide Web in bioinformatics. Written by one of the leaders in this field, Introduction to Protein Architecture explains the general characteristics of proteins that underlie the very great variety of folding patterns observed in nature. For specialists in structural biology, it contains the core of what they need to know. For students and workers in related disciplines, undergraduates or beginning graduate students in biology, chemistry, medicine, bioinformatics, and related fields it contains what they will be able to apply to their own work. Topics treated include: Pattern and form in protein structure; The building blocks; The relationship between amino acid sequence and protein structure; Secondary, supersecondary and tertiary structure; Classifications and hierarchies of protein folding patterns; Protein evolution; How proteins change conformation (and why). To suit the needs of courses, each chapter includes recommended reading, lists of useful web sites, traditional exercises, and a new type of exercise called a weblem, for WEB-based probLEM.},

They are often involved in transport processes and are promising antimicrobial drug targets. Structures of only a few $\beta$-barrel protein families are known. Therefore, a method that could automatically generate such models would be valuable. The symmetrical arrangement of the barrels suggests that an approach based on idealized geometries may be successful.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we present tobmodel; a method for generating 3D models of $\beta$-barrel transmembrane proteins. First, alternative topologies are obtained from the BOCTOPUS topology predictor. Thereafter, several 3D models are constructed by using different angles of the $\beta$-sheets. Finally, the best model is selected based on agreement with a novel predictor, ZPRED3, which predicts the distance from the center of the membrane for each residue, i.e. the Z-coordinate. The Z-coordinate prediction has an average error of 1.61 {\AA}. Tobmodel predicts the correct topology for 75% of the proteins in the dataset which is a slight improvement over BOCTOPUS alone. More importantly, however, tobmodel provides a C$\alpha$ template with an average RMSD of 7.24 {\AA} from the native structure.\n\nAVAILABILITY: Tobmodel is freely available as a web server at: http://tobmodel.cbr.su.se/.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective encoding of residue contact information is crucial for protein structure prediction since it has a unique role to capture long-range residue interactions compared to other commonly used scoring terms. The residue contact information can be incorporated in structure prediction in several different ways: It can be incorporated as statistical potentials or it can be also used as constraints in ab initio structure prediction. To seek the most effective definition of residue contacts for template-based protein structure prediction, we evaluated 45 different contact definitions, varying bases of contacts and distance cutoffs, in terms of their ability to identify proteins of the same fold.\n\nRESULTS: We found that overall the residue contact pattern can distinguish protein folds best when contacts are defined for residue pairs whose C$\beta$ atoms are at 7.0 {\AA} or closer to each other. Lower fold recognition accuracy was observed when inaccurate threading alignments were used to identify common residue contacts between protein pairs. In the case of threading, alignment accuracy strongly influences the fraction of common contacts identified among proteins of the same fold, which eventually affects the fold recognition accuracy. The largest deterioration of the fold recognition was observed for $\beta$-class proteins when the threading methods were used because the average alignment accuracy was worst for this fold class. When results of fold recognition were examined for individual proteins, we found that the effective contact definition depends on the fold of the proteins. A larger distance cutoff is often advantageous for capturing spatial arrangement of the secondary structures which are not physically in contact. For capturing contacts between neighboring $\beta$ strands, considering the distance between C$\alpha$ atoms is better than the C$\beta$-based distance because the side-chain of interacting residues on $\beta$ strands sometimes point to opposite directions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Residue contacts defined by C$\beta$-C$\beta$ distance of 7.0 {\AA} work best overall among tested to identify proteins of the same fold. We also found that effective contact definitions differ from fold to fold, suggesting that using different residue contact definition specific for each template will lead to improvement of the performance of threading.},

abstract = {Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself--the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95(pdz3)) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95(pdz3) quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins.},

SCOP2 is a successor to the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) database. Similarly to SCOP, the main focus of SCOP2 is to organize structurally characterized proteins according to their structural and evolutionary relationships. SCOP2 was designed to provide a more advanced framework for protein structure annotation and classification. It defines a new approach to the classification of proteins that is essentially different from SCOP, but retains its best features. The SCOP2 classification is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence. The new classification project is expected to ensure new advances in the field and open new areas of research.},

abstract = {The J-UNIO (JCSG protocol using the software UNIO) procedure for automated protein structure determination by NMR in solution is introduced. In the present implementation, J-UNIO makes use of APSY-NMR spectroscopy, 3D heteronuclear-resolved [(1)H,(1)H]-NOESY experiments, and the software UNIO. Applications with proteins from the JCSG target list with sizes up to 150 residues showed that the procedure is highly robust and efficient. In all instances the correct polypeptide fold was obtained in the first round of automated data analysis and structure calculation. After interactive validation of the data obtained from the automated routine, the quality of the final structures was comparable to results from interactive structure determination. Special advantages are that the NMR data have been recorded with 6-10 days of instrument time per protein, that there is only a single step of chemical shift adjustments to relate the backbone signals in the APSY-NMR spectra with the corresponding backbone signals in the NOESY spectra, and that the NOE-based amino acid side chain chemical shift assignments are automatically focused on those residues that are heavily weighted in the structure calculation. The individual working steps of J-UNIO are illustrated with the structure determination of the protein YP_926445.1 from Shewanella amazonensis, and the results obtained with 17 JCSG targets are critically evaluated.},

@article{Park2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multibody potentials accounting for cooperative effects of molecular interactions have shown better accuracy than typical pairwise potentials. The main challenge in the development of such potentials is to find relevant structural features that characterize the tightly folded proteins. Also, the side-chains of residues adopt several specific, staggered conformations, known as rotamers within protein structures. Different molecular conformations result in different dipole moments and induce charge reorientations. However, until now modeling of the rotameric state of residues had not been incorporated into the development of multibody potentials for modeling non-bonded interactions in protein structures.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we develop a new multibody statistical potential which can account for the influence of rotameric states on the specificity of atomic interactions. In this potential, named "rotamer-dependent atomic statistical potential" (ROTAS), the interaction between two atoms is specified by not only the distance and relative orientation but also by two state parameters concerning the rotameric state of the residues to which the interacting atoms belong. It was clearly found that the rotameric state is correlated to the specificity of atomic interactions. Such rotamer-dependencies are not limited to specific type or certain range of interactions. The performance of ROTAS was tested using 13 sets of decoys and was compared to those of existing atomic-level statistical potentials which incorporate orientation-dependent energy terms. The results show that ROTAS performs better than other competing potentials not only in native structure recognition, but also in best model selection and correlation coefficients between energy and model quality.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A new multibody statistical potential, ROTAS accounting for the influence of rotameric states on the specificity of atomic interactions was developed and tested on decoy sets. The results show that ROTAS has improved ability to recognize native structure from decoy models compared to other potentials. The effectiveness of ROTAS may provide insightful information for the development of many applications which require accurate side-chain modeling such as protein design, mutation analysis, and docking simulation.},

abstract = {The determination of macromolecular structures requires weighting of experimental evidence relative to prior physical information. Although it can critically affect the quality of the calculated structures, experimental data are routinely weighted on an empirical basis. At present, cross-validation is the most rigorous method to determine the best weight. We describe a general method to adaptively weight experimental data in the course of structure calculation. It is further shown that the necessity to define weights for the data can be completely alleviated. We demonstrate the method on a structure calculation from NMR data and find that the resulting structures are optimal in terms of accuracy and structural quality. Our method is devoid of the bias imposed by an empirical choice of the weight and has some advantages over estimating the weight by cross-validation.},

To assess the generality of the approach, we applied SPICKER to 1489 representative benchmark proteins Յ200 residues that cover the PDB at the level of 35% sequence identity; each contains up to 280,000 structure decoys generated using the recently developed TASSER (Threading ASSembly Refinement) algorithm. The best of the top five identified folds has a root-mean-square deviation from native (RMSD) in the top 1.4% of all decoys. For 78% of the proteins, the difference in RMSD from native to the identified models and RMSD from native to the absolutely best individual decoy is below 1 {\AA}; the majority belong to the targets with converged conformational distributions. Although native fold identification from divergent decoy structures remains a challenge, our overall results show significant improvement over our previous clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {Modeling of protein structure from amino acid sequence now plays a major role in structural biology. Here we report new developments and progress from the CASP11 community experiment, assessing the state of the art in structure modeling. Notable points include the following: (1) New methods for predicting three dimensional contacts resulted in a few spectacular template free models in this CASP, whereas models based on sequence homology to proteins with experimental structure continue to be the most accurate. (2) Refinement of initial protein models, primarily using molecular dynamics related approaches, has now advanced to the point where the best methods can consistently (though slightly) improve nearly all models. (3) The use of relatively sparse NMR constraints dramatically improves the accuracy of models, and another type of sparse data, chemical crosslinking, introduced in this CASP, also shows promise for producing better models. (4) A new emphasis on modeling protein complexes, in collaboration with CAPRI, has produced interesting results, but also shows the need for more focus on this area. (5) Methods for estimating the accuracy of models have advanced to the point where they are of considerable practical use. (6) A first assessment demonstrates that models can sometimes successfully address biological questions that motivate experimental structure determination. (7) There is continuing progress in accuracy of modeling regions of structure not directly available by comparative modeling, while there is marginal or no progress in some other areas.

abstract = {Nature has shaped the make up of proteins since their appearance, [Formula: see text]3.8 billion years ago. However, the fundamental drivers of structural change responsible for the extraordinary diversity of proteins have yet to be elucidated. Here we explore if protein evolution affects folding speed. We estimated folding times for the present-day catalog of protein domains directly from their size-modified contact order. These values were mapped onto an evolutionary timeline of domain appearance derived from a phylogenomic analysis of protein domains in 989 fully-sequenced genomes. Our results show a clear overall increase of folding speed during evolution, with known ultra-fast downhill folders appearing rather late in the timeline. Remarkably, folding optimization depends on secondary structure. While alpha-folds showed a tendency to fold faster throughout evolution, beta-folds exhibited a trend of folding time increase during the last [Formula: see text]1.5 billion years that began during the "big bang" of domain combinations. As a consequence, these domain structures are on average slow folders today. Our results suggest that fast and efficient folding of domains shaped the universe of protein structure. This finding supports the hypothesis that optimization of the kinetic and thermodynamic accessibility of the native fold reduces protein aggregation propensities that hamper cellular functions.},

By considering a diverse set of materials and biological systems with markedly different dimensionalities, topologies, and polarizabilities, we find a visible enhancement in the nonlocality of the charge density response in the range of 10 to 20 nanometers.

abstract = {Motivation: Statistical potentials have been widely used for modeling whole proteins and their parts (e.g. sidechains and loops) as well as interactions between proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Here, we formulate the statistical potentials entirely within a statistical framework, avoiding questionable statistical mechanical assumptions and approximations, including a definition of the reference state., Results: We derive a general Bayesian framework for inferring statistically optimized atomic potentials (SOAP) in which the reference state is replaced with data-driven ‘recovery’ functions. Moreover, we restrain the relative orientation between two covalent bonds instead of a simple distance between two atoms, in an effort to capture orientation-dependent interactions such as hydrogen bonds. To demonstrate this general approach, we computed statistical potentials for protein–protein docking (SOAP-PP) and loop modeling (SOAP-Loop). For docking, a near-native model is within the top 10 scoring models in 40% of the PatchDock benchmark cases, compared with 23 and 27% for the state-of-the-art ZDOCK and FireDock scoring functions, respectively. Similarly, for modeling 12-residue loops in the PLOP benchmark, the average main-chain root mean square deviation of the best scored conformations by SOAP-Loop is 1.5 {\AA}, close to the average root mean square deviation of the best sampled conformations (1.2 {\AA}) and significantly better than that selected by Rosetta (2.1 {\AA}), DFIRE (2.3 {\AA}), DOPE (2.5 {\AA}) and PLOP scoring functions (3.0 {\AA}). Our Bayesian framework may also result in more accurate statistical potentials for additional modeling applications, thus affording better leverage of the experimentally determined protein structures., Availability and implementation: SOAP-PP and SOAP-Loop are available as part of MODELLER (http://salilab.org/modeller)., Contact:

@article{Stein1997,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics in torsion-angle space was applied to nuclear magnetic resonance structure calculation using nuclear Overhauser effect-derived distances and J-coupling-constant-derived dihedral angle restraints. Compared to two other commonly used algorithms, molecular dynamics in Cartesian space and metric-matrix geometry combined with Cartesian molecular dynamics, the method shows increased computational efficiency and success rate for large proteins, and it shows a dramatically increased radius of convergence for DNA. The torsion-angle molecular dynamics algorithm starts from an extended strand conformation and proceeds in four stages: high-temperature torsion-angle molecular dynamics, slow-cooling torsion-angle molecular dynamics, Cartesian molecular dynamics, and minimization. Tests were carried out using experimental NMR data for protein G, interleukin-8, villin 14T, and a 12 base-pair duplex of DNA, and simulated NMR data for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. For villin 14T , a monomer consisting of 126 residues, structure determination by torsion-angle molecular dynamics has a success rate of 85%, a more than twofold improvement over other methods. In the case of the 12 base-pair DNA duplex, torsion-angle molecular dynamics had a success rate of 52% while Cartesian molecular dynamics and metric-matrix distance geometry always failed.},
